# Introduction

Pokémon TCG2 was released on March 28, 2001, exclusively in Japan, and was the last Pokémon game released for the Game Boy Color. Approximately two months before the game was released in Japan, IGN called it by the English title "Pokémon Trading Card Game 2: Return of Team Rocket" and declared that an English release of the game was likely. However, this obviously never happened. Despite its growing popularity, it hasn't been officially localized outside of Japan and probably never will.

In 2010, Artemis251 began working on an English translation patch, despite not knowing know how to read or speak Japanese. They state on their [website](http://artemis251.fobby.net/pkmntcg2/index.html), "I figured that, since all attempts to translate the game have gone dead, I'd take a stab at it myself. Now, I'll admit that I really don't know Japanese, but I've done a 'best-effort' with the best online translators and context clue ad-libbing
that I could." The translation wouldn't be finished and available for download until June 14th, 2012.

The game adds many new features not present in the original, such as new cards, the ability to play as a female character, a much more expansive in-game world, and contains nearly all of the cards from Base Set, Jungle, Fossil, and Team Rocket. It also features a more developed story in that, rather than just collecting cards and defeating the Grand Masters, the player must defeat a new villainous team, Team Great Rocket.

# Road Map

Some of the achievements are progression based and can't be missed, or done out of order, but many of them can be done at any time. The missable achievements are mostly events that open up and close when certain conditions are met and battles with your Rival that you can only attempt once.

This guide will have the missable achievements listed first, in the order they appear in the game, for convenience. This will put the missable achievements out of order from the achievement list on RA. The rest will be in the RA order otherwise.

It's possible to have both cups begin at the same time.

_Receive the Gengar Coin for winning 50 consecutive matches on the GR Challenge Machine!_

* After defeating Villicilli, the Challenge Machine becomes available in Dr. Mason's lab and the GR Challenge Machine in GR Island's Challenge Hall. The machine tracks your "consecutive wins" after each set of five opponents you defeat. Saving after each set is recommended and resetting from a save doesn't interrupt your winning streak.

* You can't stop a set until all five opponents are defeated. If you try, you're warned that your streak will end. A lady will approach you and hand you the coin upon the 50th consecutive match win.

* The opponents are chosen at random. You'll fight three club trainers, a club/fort leader, and a "main boss". Main bosses are: Ronald, Villicilli, Aaron (Mason's Lab tutorial trainer), and both of Villicilli's executives.

* The easiest way to defeat each set is to build a Legendary Zapdos Deck. Read the "Legendary Zapdos Deck" section at the bottom of the guide for details.

_Get 10 Heads in the Coin Flip Combo Game, and claim Mew Lv8!_

* It's uncertain if results are predetermined before each flip, like they are in duels, or if there's an actual strategy to it. Just keep playing until you win. It can take a few minutes or a few hours. Good luck!

_End any match in a draw!_

* Easiest way is to challenge Brandon in the Lightning Club using a Golem/Diglett Deck.

Strategy Tips: 

* Play Diglett as the active Pokémon. It has resistance to Electric but Geodude doesn't.
* Build up to a Golem with enough energy for Self Destruct. Don't waste turns/energy on Diglett.
* Use Scoop Up to return Diglett to your hand, leaving only Golem left in play.
* Work your opponent down to their last Pokémon using Avalanche and then Self Destruct.
* Computer Search, Pokémon Trader, Pokémon Breeder, and Pokéball make it much easier to get what you need quickly.

* This must be done while you have two or more prizes left to win. If the final Pokémon you knock out would allow you to draw your final prize, the match is counted as a win instead of a draw. If your opponent benches more than two Pokémon, reset and try again.

_Defeat Axel by obtaining all prizes without ever KO-ing his active Pokémon! [No In-Battle Save]_

Recommended Build: Stretch Kick Deck

Strategy Tips:

* It's common for Axel to open up with Scyther. He'll attach single energy, Swords Dance each turn, and then prioritize his bench. Scyther resists Fighting so he thinks it's the best option to stall with until then. The AI isn't checking to see if your Pokémon can attack the bench directly. This gives you time to set up and do some damage.

* He'll try to fill his bench and set up Wigglytuff as soon as possible. With a full bench, he can 1-hit K.O Hitmonlee using "Do the Wave".

* Remove energy from Jiggly/Wiggly when you're able and Gust of Wind to keep them benched if necessary. He usually won't bring them back out until Wigglytuff is ready or he has no other options.

* Use Stretch Kick, attack his bench, and focus on knocking out Jiggly/Wiggly first. Go for whatever you want afterwards until you win.

* Computer Search and Itemfinder can be used to find energy removal cards, or return them to your hand, to keep him from setting up. There's plenty of fodder cards in the deck to fuel them.

* Recycle Energy is for feeding Super Energy Removal, and Super Potions, since it comes right back to your hand. It doesn't return to you if you discard it to use Computer Search or Itemfinder.

> **Note: If anyone has a more efficient deck build, let me know, and I'll update the guide.**

_Defeat Magician by obtaining all prizes without ever dealing more than 20 damage in a single attack to a Pokémon! [No In-Battle Save]_

Recommended Build: Toxic Persian Deck

Strategy Tips:

* He'll try to get Alakazam and Tentacool onto the bench as quickly as possible. Alakazam has "Damage Swap" to move damage around and Tentacool has "Cowardice" to return it to his hand. This lets him move damage to Tentacool, return it, play it, and repeat this until all damage has been removed from all of his Pokémon.

* He uses Mr. Mime's "Neutral Damage" to remove weakness/resistance as well. This lets him damage Colorless Pokémon and keep Psychic from doing more damage than he can remove.

* Try to get Muk onto your bench ASAP and keep it there. It's only there for the Pokémon Power, "Toxic Gas", which blocks all other Pokémon Powers. The 20 damage per turn cap would make it very difficult to K.O. anything but, as long as "Toxic Gas" is in effect, he can't move damage around, return Tentacool, or remove your resistance to Psychic. It renders his strategy completely useless.

* Poison damage is done in between turns, and doesn't count towards the 20 damage cap, making Dark Persian's "Poison Claws" perfect for the job.

* Gambler's are used to shuffle your hand back into your deck, not draw cards. It's a battle of attrition and his primary goal isn't to knock out your team; it's to out last you. When your hand gets to 20+, use Gambler to shuffle it back in so you don't overdraw. He uses 4 Nightly Garbage Run's to keep from overdrawing before you.

_Defeat Warren by obtaining all prizes after playing at least 15 Trainer cards! [No In-Battle Save]_

Recommended Build: Legendary Zapdos Deck

Strategy Tips:

* You can start defeating his Pokémon and collecting your prizes right away. As long as you play 15 trainers before drawing the final prize, you're good.

* The Legendary Zapdos Deck utilizes so many trainer cards so it's easy to burn through 15 quickly.

> **Note: If anyone has a more efficient build, let me know, and I'll update this information.**

_Defeat Pierrot using Moltres' Wildfire to reduce his deck down to 0 cards! [No In-Battle Save]_

Recommended Deck Build: Wildfire Deck

Strategy Tips:

* Legendary Moltress is good for drawing extra fire energy quickly. You can fight the Grand Masters to get multiple copies or use the Black Box to make your own.

* Computer Error's are great in the early game. He'll usually choose to draw 5 cards and whittle his deck down quicker.

* You don't have to burn a lot of his deck down to win. You just need to make sure you use Wild Fire to remove the last card before he draws it.

* He has some draw items, like Bill and Computer Search, which should make the match move quickly. Keep his bench as empty as you can, heal as necessary, and wait him out. When the opportunity presents itself, use Wildfire, and call it a day.

**Note: If anyone has a more efficient deck build, let me know, and I'll update this information.**

_Defeat Toby by obtaining all prizes without your active Pokémon ever becoming poisoned! [No In-Battle Save]_

Recommended Deck Build: Legendary Zapdos Deck

Strategy Tips:

* Taking him out as quick as possible before he can get his Magmar or Weedle out is the goal.

* It's common for him to open up with Kangaskhan, like many other trainers, in order to use Fetch and set up his bench quickly. Kangaskhan can't poison so it's great if it's his active Pokemon. Keeping energy off of Kangaskhan so it can't retreat is a solid plan.

* His doesn't really prioritize much and doesn't have a wild strategy or anything. Generally, he tries to get a Magmar or Weedle out onto the field and defeat you using poison. He doesn't always do this but will try if the opportunity presents itself.

* Energy removal and Gust of Wind, to drag his Kangaskhan's onto the field, will help ensure that you won't get poisoned. He has a few Switch's in his deck but, with a little luck, you can keep one step ahead.

_Defeat Frank using Pidgeot's Hurricane while he has no benched Pokemon! [No In-Battle Save]_

Recommended Deck Build

Strategy Tips: Hurricane Deck

* Use searching items, such as Computer Search and Pokeball, to find your evolution cards quickly. If you already have them, Double Colorless Energy or Gust of Wind are solid choices.

* He has four Chansey and he'll prioritize them, if he can. He'll attach enough energy to Chansey and use Scrunch to stall while he powers up Zapdos on the bench. He can use Scoop Up to get Chansey off the field, if retreating isn't an option, so don't wait until the last moment to start removing energy from Zapdos.

* Gust of Wind is useful in order to drag Zapdos onto the field, and Hurricane it back to his hand, if you don't have any energy removal cards available to you at the time.

* He uses energy removal cards but you should end up with plenty energy to keep Pidgeot at full power. Wing Attack his Pokémon until you can Hurricane for the win. With good RNG, you can get Pidgeot onto the field, and be ready to Hurricane, before he can start filling his bench.

_Defeat Masquerade by deck out without ever picking up a prize card! [No In-Battle Save]_

Recommended Build: Stall for Time Deck

Strategy Tips:

* Since the goal isn't to attack, Chansey makes for a great stall. 120HP and Scrunch make it very hard to kill. His deck is mostly Colorless with a few water and two Mewtwo mixed in.

* Opening with a Kangaskhan isn't uncommon in order to use Fetch and build his bench. He usually won't bother attacking with it, like most trainers, until he has all that he needs to begin his onslaught. It's meant to be a Fetch tank so he can draw what he needs quicker.

* Computer Error is great in the early game, as he'll choose to draw five each time, if his deck is still mostly full. That'll easily put you 20 cards ahead of the curve. Use your Computer Error's and Bill's to draw everything you need to stay alive, such as healing items and energy removal, and use Gambler once your hand gets too large so you don't overdraw before he does.

* Pokecenter is good for removing all damage from Chansey at once. If you have Recycle Energy attached, they'll come right back to your hand, and you can easily keep stalling with Scrunch.

* Much like with dueling Magician, it's a battle of attrition, except Masquerade doesn't have any cards to refill his deck from the discard pile. Keep energy off his Pokemon, drag useless stuff off of his bench and into play, and wait him out.

_Defeat Anna after dealing at least 300 damage at once using Exeggutor's Big Eggsplosion! [No In-Battle Save]_

Recommended Build: Overkill Eggsplosion Deck

Strategy Tips:

* Her deck is mostly Psychic and it's another battle of attrition.

* Big Eggsplosion takes, at minimum, 15 energy cards to do the job. Since it's virtually impossible to get 15 heads in a row, you'll want to put as much onto Exeggutor as you can. I recommend 25+ for plenty of padding to account for bad flips. She doesn't use any energy removal so no worries there.

* Chansey can soak damage until you're ready but don't use it to knock out any of her Pokemon. You only get six chances, if her bench is full, before you win from drawing all your prizes.

* Since Chansey resists Psychic, healing items aren't really a priority. At most, she can only do 10 damage to it per turn if she has a Psychic on the field. Use Gust of Wind to drag one into the open, if she puts out Clefairy/Celfable, and Scrunch for a little extra protection.

* Build up energy until you feel comfortable, swap in Exeggutor, start blasting away, and hope for the best. With a little luck, you should get it on the first duel.

_Defeat Mary after not playing any cards (except during setup) until your fifth turn! [No In-Battle Save]_

Recommended Build: Legendary Zapdos Deck (add Chansey)

Strategy Tips:

* Her deck only has Water Pokemon in it. She'll prioritize getting Blastoise onto the field to Raindance as quickly as possible. She has a lot of item drawing/searching cards to speed up the process and draw a lot of energy in preparation for it.

* Opening with Chansey will help to soak damage until enough turns have passed. Chances are good that she'll have Blastoise on the bench and her Pokémon will be powered up by then.

* Use Chansey to soak damage, get Zapdos ready as soon as you're able, and blast away.

_Record all 443 cards into the album!_

* The Legendary Zapdos deck is one of the quickest to farm with since Zapdos' attack is easy to set up, deals a lot of damage, and ignores resistance. This makes it extremely versatile in practically all situations.

* I've composed a list of all the trainers, where they're located, what packs they give, and how many.

* Each each card is organized the same way as the Card Album. You can Ctrl+F to quickly search for anything you need by album number. This way, you know specifically what you're looking for in each one. It also has every Promo and where/how to obtain them.

* Lastly, it has my recommendations for which trainers are the most efficient to farm for packs, based on what they give, how quickly/easily they are to beat, and why I recommend them. They're based on using the Legendary Zapdos Deck and you can begin farming every pack card as soon as you can access the Black Box. Read the "Legendary Zapdos Deck" section at the bottom of the guide to learn how to build the deck early.

* If you end up with a ton of chips, while grinding for "The Elusive Mew", purchase Present packs. They contain every card that's obtainable from all seven packs. It's a great way to get an early head start on fleshing out your collection, but has diminishing returns, making it less efficient over time. Spend extra chips on packs but don't bother farming more past that.

* The Black Box isn't really all that useful in the long run. It has few recipes to generate specific cards but it's not worth it otherwise. The list has all currently known recipes that I could find. If anyone knows any that aren't listed, let me know and I'll add them.

* If you did all the trading achievements, you'll have enough Bill's Computer's to get all five promo's without needing to purchase extras. It doesn't matter which card you feed it since each one will yield the same thing. Ex: if you have three different Machoke's, it doesn't matter which one you put in. You'll always get the same Machamp back.

# Legendary Zapdos Deck

You'd normally obtain a Zapdos Lv68 after "rescuing" Rod from the GR Psychic Fortress and defeating the Grand Masters. This isn't the only way to obtain one, though. It can also be made in the Black Box at the Game Center.

Black Box Recipe:

* Raichu Lv40 (Assault)
* Zapdos Lv64 (Premier)
* Dark Raichu Lv31 (Ambition)
* Empty
* Empty

This will result in a Zapdos Lv68 every time. Ambition packs, for the Dark Raichu, don't start showing up as rewards until the Fire/Water Fort. There's a small chance you could get one in a Present pack in the Game Center, though, allowing you to make the deck much sooner. The other two can be farmed on TCG Island.

Listed below is the build I used. I found it to be very consistent against almost every opponent. If anyone has improvements to the deck that they'd like to share, let me know.

Pokemon:
* Zapdos Lv68

Trainers:
* Super Potion x4
* Energy Removal x4
* Potion x4
* Gambler x2
* Super Energy Removal x4
* Gust of Wind x4
* Full Heal x4
* Computer Search x3
* Bill x4

Energy:
* Electric Energy x18
* Full Heal Energy x4
* Recycle Energy x4

Strategy Tips:

* Using only a single Zapdos ensures you'll draw it at the start. "Big Thunder" randomly targets any Pokémon that isn't Zapdos. You don't have to worry about wasting a turn nuking your own bench by accident if you don't have one.

* "Big Thunder" deals 70 damage, ignores resistance, and can take out any potential threats while they're still on the bench. Most Pokémon that opponents use don't have more than 70hp, making it a one-hit K.O. almost every turn. It's one of the fastest ways to burn through an opponents team before they have a chance to get their decks going.

* Gambler's are meant to keep you from accidentally overdrawing. They're a preventative against opponents that lean heavily on energy removal cards, such as Claire, and slow down the deck. Hold onto them until your hand is larger than 12 cards, at least.

* Gust of Wind's are great for drawing out high cost Pokémon, such as Kangaskhan or Chansey, that can't/won't attack. It makes the deck less reliant on healing items so you're not always scrambling to draw one.

* Computer Search is for finding Electric Energy if you get an unfavorable starting hand. You can search for a Bill but there's no guarantee you'll get any energy when you play it. Otherwise, use it as needed to grab energy removal or healing. It's more versatile than Energy Search.

* Recycle Energy is for fueling Super Potions and Super Energy Removals. It'll come back to your hand each time so you never have to worry about discarding a necessary energy. You can play them as soon as you draw them. Opponents will target your electric energy first since it's needed for your attack. Attaching multiples will let you play multiple Super Potions and Super Energy Removal's in a single turn if you have to.

* Full Heal Energy increase your odds of getting a Full Heal item in hand. Many opponents have status effect moves in their decks and you don't want any of them slowing you down by not being able to attack.

* Some trainer cards may not be necessary against some opponents. They're used as fodder for Computer Search in those situations.

* The deck can be easily tweaked for specific achievements like "Leave Axel Friendless". Swap Zapdos for Hitmonlee and Electric Energy for Fighting Energy. It's very versatile for achievements where Zapdos is too powerful.
