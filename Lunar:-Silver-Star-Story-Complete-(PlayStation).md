# 2) Introduction

![Game Badge](https://retroachievements.org/Images/017724.png)

[Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete](https://retroachievements.org/game/11254), originally released in Japan as simply Lunar: Silver Star Story (ルナ~シルバースターストーリー, Runa ~Shirubā Sutā Sutōrī), is a role-playing video game developed by Game Arts and Japan Art Media as a remake of 1992's Lunar: The Silver Star. While the overall plot remains true to the original, accommodations are made to the game's story to allow for a larger, richer cast, as well as additional scenarios.

Initially released on the Sega Saturn in 1996, the game has gone through several variations, beginning with enhanced video support in conjunction with the Saturn's MPEG graphics add-on in 1997, and later being ported to Sony's PlayStation in 1998. The PlayStation version was released in North America by Working Designs, who had also produced the English adaptation of the original game, in May 1999.

Like its forerunner, the game follows the exploits of Alex, a young boy from a small, humble town who enters a life of adventure and intrigue after being chosen as the heir-apparent to the title of "Dragonmaster", guardian of the forces of the planet. With the help of his expanding band of companions, Alex must pass the trials set by ancient dragons to claim his place in history, and stop a powerful sorcerer and former hero from controlling the world.

Since its English release, Silver Star Story has garnered much attention from critics for its use of fluid full-motion animated sequences, lavish game packaging, and quality of the English script. The game was followed by a sequel, Lunar 2: Eternal Blue Complete, in 1998. Two more remakes of Lunar: The Silver Star, Lunar Legend and Lunar: Silver Star Harmony, were released in 2002 by Media Rings and Ubisoft and in 2009 by GungHo Online Entertainment and Xseed Games, respectively.

### [The Golden Egg](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/160030)

![Badge](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/179880.png)
*Pay off Ramus' debt*

With Ramus in your party and before going to the White Dragon Cave, go upstairs at the weapon shop in Burg and talk to the man there. You will need to pay him a very small amount of money. If you don't have it, sell something.

Point of no return - Entering the White Dragon Cave

### [Thanks, but No Thanks](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/156300)

![Badge](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/179692.png)
*Refuse Laike's help in Weird Woods and win all three battles*

When you're a little over halfway through the Weird Woods, the party will be ambushed. Laike will come to your aid, but you can refuse his help. Every time you refuse, you will enter a battle with eight enemies. After the third battle, you'll be in the clear and Laike will introduce himself.

Point of no return - Accepting Laike's help.

### [Kleenex Party](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/161686)

![Badge](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/181857.png)
*Buy at least two bars of soap while aboard the Hispaniola*

This is the only spot in the game where you can buy soap (you need it for the hot springs cheevos) and you'll only be here for a brief amount of time. Do it as soon as you gain control of Alex after boarding the ship.

Point of no return - Talking to your party members on the ship. I think you have one more chance after that, though.

### [Overwhelm the Helm](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/161647)

![Badge](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/181858.png)

After gaining control of Alex aboard the ship, go up to the deck and talk to the helmsman twice.

Point of no return - Talking to your party members on the ship.

![Badge](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/181828.png)
*Clear the Cave of Trials in one session without being healed by test administrators*

**BACK-UP SAVE ALERT:** Save before using the teleporter to the Cave of Trials for the first time.

You will need to clear the entire cave in one go without talking to the administrators. Leaving the cave and coming back *should* reset it, but it's not guaranteed. I will confirm and edit this afterwards.

### [Zoc'd and Loaded](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/161701)

![Badge](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/181846.png)

![Badge](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/179884.png)
*Clear Lann Island from start to finish in one boat ride*

**BACK-UP SAVE ALERT:** Save before talking to the guy next to the boat in Lann after Jessica joins. Leaving the island at all will lock you out of this achievement. I definitely recommend making a back-up save here because you will need to leave the island in order to obtain a bromide anyway.

### [Hard to Get](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/156311)

![Badge](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/179674.png)

![Badge](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/181014.png)
*Clear Crystal Tower with no weapons equipped (aka No Dragonfly Wing glitch)*

While you're supposed to do this anyway, there's a glitch that will allow you to get through the tower with weapons equipped. This achievement is here to make sure you don't do that.

Point of no return - Who cares? Don't cheat.

### [I'm a Big Boy, Huh?](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/161632)

![Badge](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/181703.png)
*Have Alex gain a level while Ghaleon is in the party*

Ghaleon is only in your party for a brief period of time. 

Point of no return - Talking to Quark at White Dragon Cave while Ghaleon is in your party.

### [Cane of Mim](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/160010)

![Badge](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/181859.png)
*Obtain the Ice Mace from the Old Hag*

Remember that cane you gave to the Old Hag? Well, before talking to Ghaleon to sail back to Saith, go to Black Rose Street and find the Old Hag's sister. Talk to her until she mentions her sister. Upon returning and leaving Saith, go visit the Old Hag before going to Burg to get the cane.

Point of no return - Several since it has multiple requirements.

### [Hometown Show-Off](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/156315)

![Badge](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/181813.png)

![Badge](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/181805.png)
*Defeat Xenobia's forces with Kyle in Nanza in two rounds*

Self-explanatory.

### [A Fighter, Not a Prestidigitator](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/156318)

![Badge](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/181863.png)
*Have each party member make a clay sculpture for Damon*

You will have a chance to pick each party member before you decide on Alex doing it. Alex doing it is required to progress, so make sure you have everyone else attempt it first.

Point of no return - Alex making the sculpture.

### [Feisty Little Things](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/158669)

![Badge](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/181834.png)
*In Iluk Field, catch a Fluffy Bug after engaging in only one Fluffy Bug battle.*

Iluk Field has several Fluffy Bugs throughout the map, but the only one you can catch is in the Northwestern-most section. You will need to avoid the others and only confront that one. Fluffy Bugs are not that aggressive on the map so they're not likely to chase you down like most enemies will.

Point of no return - Catching the Fluffy Bug.

### [Hot Dogs](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/161692)

![Badge](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/181837.png)

### [In Plain Sight](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/159780)

![Badge](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/181810.png)
*Read Ghaleon's Diary*

It's on his desk upstairs at the Magic Guild in Vane. I'm not sure when exactly it becomes missable, but you have probably have over half of the game to do it. I'd do it before leaving for the Frontier.

### [Honor Among Thieves](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/159784)

![Badge](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/181865.png)
*Return the Old Notebook to the Thieves' Guild agent in Meryod*

The Thieves' Guild agent is the guy standing against the wall in the bar in Meryod. Talk to him after talking to Damon.

Point of no return - Returning to the Thieves' Guild.

### [No Broken Rhythm](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/159788)

![Badge](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/179898.png)

![Badge](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/181867.png)
*Defeat all the Water Elementals in Blue Dragon Shrine*

It just occurred to me that I never tried going back to the Blue Dragon Shrine after completing it so I'm not 100% sure about this one. I'll update this when I know.

### [Noa Constrictor](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/161693)

![Badge](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/181838.png)

*Obtain Ghaleon's Tear*

As soon as Alex becomes a Dragonmaster, go talk to the chief in Lann and choose the first option. After Vane is destroyed, go back to Lann and talk to him again.

### [Regen Authority](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/161593)

![Badge](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/181891.png)
*Obtain all three Healing Rings*

I said I'd leave out anything that becomes missable due to the Grindery, but this is an exception considering one of them is actually in the Grindery. Make sure you obtained the other two before going there.

### [Rapscallion Ghaleon](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/161699)

![Badge](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/181879.png)
*Have Tempest show off all his spells [one session]*

He only has two so you'll probably get it before realizing it's an achievement. Make sure you do this while going through the Black Dragon Fortress.

### [For Thieves' Eyes Only III](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/159783)

![Badge](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/179951.png)
*Open all fourteen of the Red Chests*

Most guides only list thirteen. There's one very well hidden in Vane and eventually Vane is destroyed. I'm sure you can piece together the rest.

![Badge](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/181882.png)
