# Overview

### The achievements can be grouped into a few types.

- **Story Achievements** - these cannot be missed.
- **Collect Items** - Collect or buy certain items in the game. Non are missable.
- **Grinding for Max-Stats and Money**
- **Learn All Magic** - Learn all `Magic` in the game.
- **Beat the Arena** - There is an `Arena` in the `Caryards`. You need to beat all the stages.
- **Other Miscellaneous Types**

### General Tips

**No need to hire Shadowrunners**
- They die very easily and aren't that useful.
- The good ones are very expensive, and by the time you can afford them, you should already be strong enough to protect yourself.
- To avoid missing the second missable achievement.

**Save time for the max-stats achievements**
1. Just grind for enough Karma to max one of your stat. Do not spend it.
2. Save your game first.
3. Spend the Karma to max that stat, to earn the achievement for that specific stat.
4. Load your game, and spend the Karma on another stat.
