# 2) Introduction

Often listed as one of the greatest RPGs of all time, Final Fantasy 6 is the story of a young girl born with magical abilities in a world where magic was destroyed long ago.  The game boasts an impressive cast, quick combat and excellent music.  The set was primarily created by [cirellio](https://retroachievements.org/user/cirellio) with additional achievements by [televandalist](https://retroachievements.org/user/televandalist). Many of the achievements in the set are showcases of easter eggs or unique dialog, making a large portion of them missable during a normal playthrough. This guide will tackle the achievements in chronological order to get the most out of your playthrough.

[Shell-shocked (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/4960)
_Destroy Whelk's armored shell_

Whelk is the first boss of the game.  The shell has 50000 HP, whereas the boss has 1600.  Attacking the shell will make it counter with a party-wide attack, but it only has enough MP to do this 6 times.  Heal between attacks until it runs out of MP, then you are mostly safe.  Keep an eye on your HP, while hitting the shell with Tek-Missle and Beams.  You'll need roughly 80 rounds to finish it.
