# 2) Introduction

One of my all time favorite Atari 2600 games. While inferior in graphics to it's arcade counterpart, this version holds it's own and is allot of fun to play. I would like to credit suspect15 for a really awesome review process and helping with making this as close to the best it could be before release. Also every over at the jr. dev discord. While I don't post allot, it is usually only because someone has either already asked or because someone posts something that answers my question before I ask it, I appreciate all of the invaluable info that you all have provided.

Here is where you list the achievements and a guide for each. If multiple achievements are similar to each other and don't need a separate guide, feel free to put multiple achievement blocks below each other with a description after the final one.

For achievement blocks, please copy the one you prefer from [this page](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/wiki/Achievement-Code-Blocks), or use this [generator](https://raguides-template-generator.vercel.app/) to convert all achievements of a set.
