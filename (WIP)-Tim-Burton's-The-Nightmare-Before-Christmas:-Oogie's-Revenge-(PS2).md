# 1) Introduction

Welcome to the RA guide for **Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge** for the PS2!

The game released in 2005 for PS2 and XBOX, developed by CAPCOM, and it proposes itself as a sequel to the 1993 movie, **Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas**. The game has some similiarity to **Devil May Cry**, like the combo ranking, level progression and secrets, although it is much easier to play.

The game takes place some time after the events of the film. Jack yet again gets bored of Halloween. He goes to Doctor Finkelstein for advice in how to improve the next halloween. The Doctor gives him his newest creation: SOUL ROBBER! A green slime that acts like a whip. Jack than decides to leave Halloween Town in search for new ideas, and leaves the Doctor in charge of the town. But Lock, Shock, and Barrel took this opportunity to revive Oogie Boogie, which then began his plot to take revenge, taking over not only Halloween Town, but all the other holidays too, to become the "Seven Holidays King". Sally manages to send a letter to Jack about what was going on, so he huries back to his town to fix the mess.

⚠️ The only supported version of the game is the european version. When playing this version, the game will ask you at what refresh rate, or video mode, to play the game. Only select 60Hz to be able to earn achievements, as 50Hz is not supported.

# 2) Overview

[**Progression**](#progression)

These can't be missed and will be naturally unlocked by just playing through the game. While doing these, you should also go for the extras achievements, as this is the best opportunity to get them out of the way and to also get ready for the rest of the set.

Most importantly, you can decide to start on Nightmare Mode, the highest difficulty in the game. Despite the increse in difficulty, it is still manageable enough to get through the game. And besides, all of the challenge achievements will require this difficulty anyway.

***

[**Rank S**](#rank-s)

Most of the ranking achievements are about the A rank, as that's the requirement to be rewarded a figurine. Getting A rank is not that difficult, but getting S rank does require you to go out of your way to reach their requirements. It also needs to be done on Nightmare Mode because of The Seven Holidays King.

More about how to ranking system will be explained in The Seven Holidays King, as well as each of the A rank achievement will have tips and video guides about getting the S rank. Sadly I can't know exactly the requirements for A rank, but since we are interested more in getting the S ranks it won't matter as much.

[**The Speedrun Before Christmas**](#the-speedrun-before-christmas)

This will, or will not, be your final achievement of the set.

# 3) Tips

* **Combos** - Soul Spin (Full Rotation Left Stick, Square) is your best friend to get combos. Another suggestion to do more combos is to taunt an enemy (Directional Button) to make them more durable, especially if they're already damaged to make them replenish some health.
* **Taunt** - Taunt (Directional Button) is primarily used to get exclamation points, and it can be used repeatedly on the same enemy, even if they are already in Oogie Mode, to rack up exclamation points. You need to wait for them to finish their "startled" animation first before you're able to taunt them again.
* **Blue Souls** - Not only will they increase damage, but when using Soul Cycle (Triangle Charged), use a blue soul when you see the Soul Rubber becoming almost red to extended the move duration. This is very powerful when in enclosed areas full of normal size enemies.
* **Pumpkin King Costume** - While it is a powerful costume, with Fire Bomb (Triangle) doing very high damage, the costume is often used for puzzles and exploration, and it is better to conserve the Red Souls to avoid annoyance.
* **Santa Jack Costume** - The presents can be used against the enemies hidden in things to discover them and not be immediately retaliated. The presents can have different usages: Re-Possession takes them out of their Oogie Mode (they usualy always are when hidden), Scared Stiff will stun them in place (especially effective against Halloween and King Ghosts).
* **Dodge Extension** - Right after dodging (Circle), quickly change into any costume you have (L1 / R1) to have more invincibility. Normally, changing costume has you standing in place, but this gets cancelled out when done right after a dodge.

## Progression

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248483.png">

```
This is Oogie-Town [5]
Defeat Oogie Boogie's Shadow and recover the Halloween Door
```
`PROGRESSION`

* He will every so often throw dices at you. These can easily be dodged (Circle) with the right timing, or you can dodge them just by keeping walking left or fight.
* The Halloween Ghosts won't give that much trouble, but can be rather annoying. Soul Spin will let you damage them while also damaging Oogie Boogie's Shadow, and also collect the notes they'll drop. They can also potentially drop a Blue Soul, letting you deal more damage to Oogie Boogie's Shadow.
* When Oogie Boogie's Shadow starts to sing the WOW part of the song, the Halloween Ghosts will pick up bigger dices to drop them at you. Start to dodge them right when Oogie Boogie's Shadow sings WOW for the third time.

You'll earn the achievement at the end of the fight.

```
Damcel in Distress [5]
Defeat the Mega Spider and recover the Valentine's Day Door
```
`PROGRESSION`

* It has a weak spot on his back that when hit, he becomes many tiny versions of itself. Soul Spin is a very effective move here, as it'll attract the tiny spiders to you making it easier to hit them.
* Keep some distance from the spider, as he has 3 different attacks that he can do at random. Preferably don't stand in front of him, since he'll always turn himself to face into your direction before attacking.
* The web projectiles does not damage you, but will block you in place, even when the web is on the ground. He'll also start to spit 2 more projectiles when reaches half his health bar.

You'll earn the achievement at the end of the fight, alongside the Pumpkin Jack Costume.

```
Cerebrum Cleansed [5]
Defeat Dr. Finkelstein and recover the St Patrick's Day Door
```
`PROGRESSION`

The only way to damage him is to throw the pieces of brain at him while his head is open. You'll only need to do this 2 times and he's defeated. There are 2 ways to fight Dr. Finkelstein:
1. Grab his head from begind with triangle and repeatedly press triangle until his head opens. Then grab a piece of brain in the tray on the left of the arena and throw it right in front of him while his head is open.
2. Destroy his machines and collect the notes. Perform the dance segment successfully and his head will be open. Grab a piece of brain on the tray to the left and throw it right in front of him.

You'll earn the achievement at the end of the fight, alongside the Santa Jack Costume.

```
Thanks for Giving the Door [5]
Defeat Barrel and his Army of Skeletons and recover the Thanksgiving Door
```
`PROGRESSION`

* He fights exacly like Lock all the way back in chapter 4. He'll run around the arena and sometimes summons enemies. Follow him and hit him when possible.
* Just like Lock, he can be taunted, which stuns him and lets you Soul Spin him for high damage. You can do this repeatedly in quick succession until he's defeated.

You'll earn the achievement at the end of the fight.

```
Trick or Treat! [5]
Defeat Lock, Shock and Barrel and recover the Independence Day Door
```
`PROGRESSION`

* Dodge their traps, or grab them with square and send them back at them for damage. Be aware that they can even throw 2 traps as the same time.
* Hit the bathtub either with Soul Robber, throwing traps or the explosive pumpkins at it until destroyed.
* When the bathtub is destroyed, all three will get off of it. This time they'll try to attack you while also running from you. Of the 3, Lock is the most dangerous one, as her attack is kind of hard to avoid, so try your best to go after her.
* Fire Blast from the Pumpkin King Costume is very useful here. It'll blast them off in the air while also dealing high damage. If you can, try to hit at least 2 of them with it.

You'll earn the achievement at the end of the fight.

Boogeyman's Wager [10]
Defeat Oogie Boogie and recover the Easter Door
```
`PROGRESSION`

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248519.png">

```
A Dance of Fire and Ice [10]
Defeat the Fire King and Ice King Skeletons and recover the Christmas Door
```
`PROGRESSION`

* Both the Fire King Skeleton and the Ice King Skeleton are basically bigger King Skeleton, so just like them the best way to defeat them is to attack them from behind.
* Ice King Skeleton will go down very easily via Fire Blast from the Pumpkin King Costume. Don't use the costume against the Fire King Skeleton or it'll heal from it.
* When either of them turns black, use Santa Jack's Re-Possession present to turn them back to normal.

You'll earn the achievement at the end of the fight.

```
The Seven Holidays King [50]
Beat the game with an overall "S" ranking on all levels and successfully complete both
secret chapters on Nightmare Mode
```
`COMPLETION`

When you beat a level, the game will rank you based on different categories, and then give you a total rank of the level. The categories are:
* Time: how much time you spent to beat the level;
* Combo: Highest combo number without breaking it;
* Damage: Amount of hits taken;
* Exclamation points: These points can be earned by taunting, using Santa Jack's presents, and during dances by pressing the correct buttons.

The game tracks the highest rank you earn in each of the categories, and it does not take into consideration the final ranking you earn in a level. With this in mind, if you're finding it too difficult to S rank on first visit, you can even revisit a level and go for just one or two of the categories for S rank, then again for the other two, and the game will assign you S rank for that level.

To get a total Rank of S, not only are you needed to earn all the S ranks, but to also complete the two hidden chapters. These chapters have no ranking, and you are just required to complete them.

⚠️ Be aware that if you are going for the hidden chapters, any hits or any time you spend in these hidden chapters will count for the rankings in the main chapters, as you're still technically playing them. If you still need to do S ranks, know that the hidden chapters will make them hard to S rank. They can be done anytime, even after beating the game, so there's no rush.

## Damageless, Full Combo

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248704.png">

```
Skellinton's Revenge [10]
Defeat Oogie's Boogie's Shadow without taking damage on Nightmare Mode
```

There's not that much to look out for in this fight.\
* He does a very clear movement when he throws his dices. Immediately dodge them when they're close.
* The Halloween Ghosts can easily be dealt with with Soul Spin. They'll always come back so don't risk going for Soul Slam (Triangle).
* When at the WOW part of the song, be ready to dodge in time the big dices, right when Oogie Boogie's Shadow gets at the third WOW. It may be safer to go for a triple dodge to be safe.

Smokin' Sexy Style!! [5]
Get a Pumpkin King Combo Rank for the first time [Dances don't count]
```
Perform a total combo of 150 without breaking it to reach **Pumpkin King** combo rank.

You'll have many opportunities to do this, but the easiest to do this is in Chapter 3. Continue until you're trapped in an arena fight with Shock. Perform Soul Cycle (Charged Triangle), and keep it going using Blue Souls before the Soul Robber becomes red (sometimes the enemies drop a Blue Soul too). When you run out of Blue Souls, keep the combo going by either hitting the enemies with a normal attack or with Soul Spin (Full Rotation Left Stick, Square).

`COMPLETION` `SPEEDRUN`

If you've beaten the game, you'll have a general idea of how to progress through the game, making this achievement easier to do. If you didn't, wait until you're done with everything else, so that you'll be more prepared for this playthrough.\
Below i'll write different tips for each level and how to beat them the fastest way possible. But first, some things to keep in mind:
* You can, and must, play on easy mode for this achievement. Easy mode puts enemies on their lowest maximum health, making them faster to defeat.
* Cutscenes and pausing the game will not block the timer. The ranking screen, or the level select screen will block the timer however.
* You won't ever need to waste time to save in-game by speaking to Mr. Hyde. Only save at chapter end.
* You're not obbligated to fight most of the enemies in the game. It'll be written if some are obbligatory, but most of them you can just run away.
* Getting a good rank in each chapter means more souls to spend on upgrades, but it's ultimately not important.
* The only upgrades that you'll ever need are the Soul Robber and, maybe, the Pumpkin King costume upgrades. Santa Jack Costume will ever see usage only for progression.
* For most of the enemies, the normal Soul Robber combo (Square) will be sufficient to take care of most of the enemies as quickly as possibile. With the Halloween Ghosts and the King Ghosts it's better to use Soul Slam (Triangle), and with the Troll Skeletons and King Skeletons charge your Square and hit them from behind.

[![Speedrun Chapter 1](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/assets/133049176/09940d08-aa91-4b44-8d39-d6d3d81a1c90)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEQ3aKmckXk)

1. Fight the skeletons until Oogie Boogie starts to talk. It'll take you 6 skeletons.

2. The skeletons will continue to spawn endlessly until Oogie Boogie stops talking. Finish them off when he starts laughing.

3. Move immediately in the Town Hall to start the boss fight.

4. Hitting Shadow Oogie does lead to constant damage, but while hitting him, grab some notes so that you'll finish him off fast.

### Chapter 2

<details>

1. Talk to Corpse Kid. Optionally replenish your health at the fountain if needed. Then move to the Witches' Shop, which is nord of Corpse Kid.

2. It's unlikely that you'll have anything to buy, so after the cutscene, immediately exit. Talk to Corpse Kid again and enter into the manhole.

3. Defeat the enemies in her and talk to Clown. Then get out of the manhole through the grapple point.

4. Go to the entrance of Halloween Town, right in front of the fountain, and defeat the enemies that'll appear. Then interact with the gate.
