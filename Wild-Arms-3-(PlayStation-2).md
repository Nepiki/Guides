## **Introduction**

Wild Arms 3 was the first game in the Wild Arms series to appear on PlayStation 2.  It followed the success of the franchise on PlayStation and is generally regarded as the highest rated game in the series.  The American-western themed story is set in the desolate world of Filgaia.  You play as four drifters, adventurers who brave the wasteland in search of bounties or personal goals, Virginia Maxwell, Jet Enduro, Clive Winslett and Gallows Carradine.  The team joins together in search of solving the mystery surrounding the decay of the world and ultimately to stop the forces behind it.

The game plays out in a typical JRPG format and is rather linear.  The gameplay loop mostly consists of visiting towns and dungeons to unlock access to more towns and dungeons as the story unfolds.  There is a considerable amount of challenging bonus content in the forms of side quests, puzzles, easter eggs and more.  The game is also extremely boss centric with most dungeons having two or three different bosses with which to contend.  Overall the main story line of the game is not especially challenging to complete, but some of the side content is considerably more difficult.

The game uses an item based save system that allows saving virtually anywhere and any time.  This will affords easy repeated access to bosses or other challenging sections of gameplay.  The save items are called Gimel Coins and are found throughout the game as well as dropped by enemies.  There are also permanent save stations in each town that can be used without limit.


## **Set Design**

The overall philosophy for the set was to ensure players seeking mastery fully explore all of the content the game has to offer in a single play through and to demonstrate proficiency of the battle mechanics through boss challenges that are uniquely tailored to boss specific gimmicks or themes.  The number of missables may seem staggering at first glance, however the vast majority of them are boss challenges which are easy to not miss.

Due to the fact that the game offers a New Game+ option where only character experience, money and a single mediocre item carry over, the set uses a generous level cap restriction on all of the challenge achievements.  Additionally in a normal play through, when you gain access to your first vehicle to traverse the world, there are places that can be exploited to gain vast amounts of levels and very quickly unbalance the game's difficulty.  To ensure boss challenges are kept appropriately balanced, the level caps beyond that point in the game are kept to 5-10 levels higher than would normally be attained in a typical playthrough for any given boss.  There are also ways to prevent experience gain through status effects, so if a player is approaching an achievement level cap, they can prevent undesired leveling to ensure they remain eligible.

The only purpose of the level caps are to prevent achievement unlocks from a New Game+ save file and to ensure players do not trivialize the game's inherent difficulty by taking advantage of exceptionally easy access to significant leveling opportunities.  The level caps will not add any increased difficulty for the vast majority of players.

## **Achievement Roadmap**

The achievements are ordered in such a way as to guarantee players know which achievement they should accomplish next, except for the non-missable sidequest content or general agnostic challenge achievements.  During a mastery playthrough, players should expect to primarily stick to the main story line's progression, collection and boss challenge achievements, deviating only to unlock missable side quest content (not necessarily complete it immediately) until just before the final boss.  At that point, the player should finish all additional side content and challenges prior to fighting the final boss and mastering the set.

Due to the level cap restrictions, excessive leveling up and grinding is not needed/intended.  The only way a player can possibly find themselves in a situation where they are unable to accomplish certain boss achievements is by making terrible weapon upgrade choices and not being able to earn enough money and remain under the level cap to correct the mistakes.  This is unlikely, but conceivable.  The challenge achievements are generally very accepting of a diverse number of upgrade builds, but this roadmap will ensure that players understand which upgrades should not be neglected as well as several other important aspects of the game to consider.

**Important Arm Upgrades**
The only Arm upgrades needed to accomplish a few of the boss challenges are Clive's SHT upgrade.  By default, Clive is the strongest attacker on the team and SHT will further increase his strength.  His physical attacks and Gallows' Arcana (magic) will be the main sources of damage throughout the run.  Using your money to favor Clive's SHT will ensure you remain well positioned for all potential boss challenge achievements.  It is recommend to also invest in a few upgrades for the other characters, however when money begins to become an issue, priority should be given to Clive's SHT.

**Item Scarcity**
Until the Secret Garden sidequest is unlocked, there is no way besides occasionally getting a lucky drop after battle, to replenish your supply of Heal Berries, Potion Berries and Mini Carrots.  As such, these items should be used quite sparingly.  Some boss challenges will require the use of these items so do not be afraid to use them when needed.  When the Secret Garden becomes available, it is strongly recommended that you unlock it and begin investing into your Heal Berry, Potion Berry and Mini Carrot cultivation immediately.  This guide will discuss strategies for gardening success below in the **Fertile Grounds** achievement.  It will take a bit of effort to get started, but it is well worth it in the long run.

**FP System**
The battle system of Wild Arms 3 uses an FP system to use skills and get the most of your attacks.  In order to cast Arcana, you must have accumulated a certain amount of FP during the battle, spell dependent.  Using Arcana does not cost FP.  The more FP you have, the more powerful the Arcana will be during the battle.  Additionally, each character has special abilities or can summon a guardian that will cost FP to do.  Each character starts a battle with FP equal to their level, so the higher level you are, the more FP you initially have at your disposal.  FP is also gained through physical attacks, receiving damage and dodging enemy attacks.  It is important to understand that the higher FP you have the more effective that character's spells/summon/attacks will be.

**Save Strategy**
Wild Arms 3 is a long game.  The set is intended to be mastered in a single playthrough of the game in order to maximize the benefit to the players for committing their time to playing the set.  The PlayStation 2 Memory card can store over 100 different Wild Arms 3 save files.  Use them!  My recommended technique would be to use a different save file about every hour or two of gameplay to ensure that if you do inadvertently miss something, you are not required to replay the entire game up to that point.  This guide will ensure that you do not miss anything, however prudence will not hurt.

--INSERT ICON-- **Didn't Divide and Conquer [m]** (XXX points)

_Description_

The boss in Gallows' intro is the Kesaran Pasaran, four sphere shaped enemies near the end of the Fallen Sanctuary dungeon.  The boss gimmick is that if two or three of the enemies are defeated, the remaining one will resurrect the them.  This is to teach you to use the Extension ability which will multitarget Gallows' Arcana.  The goal of this achievement is to defeat the Kesaran Pasaran without them resurrecting at any point.  In order to do this, attack each of the enemies several times, but be careful to not kill more than one of them.  When Gallows runs out of bullets, it is safer to attack with his physical attack to build up FP as it is less likely to deal significant damage.  Once Gallows has more than 75 Arcana, use the Extension-Refrigerate skill to dispatch the Kesaran Parasan and earn the achievement.

_Description_

The finale of Clive's intro is a second boss battle against the Goldrake he first encountered in the Den of Miasma.  The Goldrake will poison Clive shortly after the fight begins and Clive will lose 20% of his max health every turn.  In order to defeat the Goldrake, Clive will have to hit it with two Lock On shots requiring a total of 50 FP.  Clive will not survive long enough to kill the Goldrake without using a Heal Berry or two as long as he remains poisoned.  Heal as necessary and defeat the Goldrake while still poisoned to earn this achievement.

--INSERT ICON-- **Train Surfer [m]** (XXX points)

_Description_

There are several aspects of this battle that need to be considered in order to unlock the achievement:

1. Do not allow any party members to fall: Virginia is the most vulnerable, so having her defend reguarly is very important.  Avoid attacking with her because if she does attack, the next time she defends, she will reload her ARM and invalidate the achievement.  She should only be used for defending herself and using an emergency Heal Berry because she will act first each turn.

2. Make sure Janus is note defeated before Dario or Romero.  As soon as Janus's HP reaches 0, the fight ends.  The goal should be to focus Clive's, Jet's and Gallows' attacks on either Dario or Romero first.  Immediately switch fire to the other as soon as the first is defeated and lastly defeat Janus.  Clive and Jet should never stop attacking and Gallows' should provide healing when necessary.  Clive and Jet will surely run out of bullets fairly early in the fight, but still do reasonable damage with physical attacks.  Continue to chip away at the enemies with physical attacks until they are defeated.

3. Do not defend after shooting an ARM because that will reload the bullets and invalidate the achievement.  Because the risk to Virginia is too high, she should never fire her ARM during this fight to preserve her defend option.

_Description_

If you speak with Halle again before departing Baskar Colony to battle the four guardians at the Fallen Sanctuary, she will tell you the order that she defeated the guardians many years ago.  This achievement requires you to defeat them in the same order.  The achievement must be done in a single session, without leaving the roof of the Fallen Sanctuary (this includes Game Overing or reseting).  The guardians must be defeated in the following order: Grudiev at the east monolith, Fengalon at the west monolith, Schturdark at the north monolith and Moor gault at the south monolith.  You will need to rely on Heal Berries for healing until after you've defeated the third guardian, so try to ensure you get the best possible economy from them.

Grudiev - Grudiev will counter every attack, but has a low hit rate.  Defend with everyone on the first turn to minimize damage from the Planet Breaker attacker that he begins the fight with.  After that, attack him as able, health dependent with all characters.  If Virginia can get to 25 FP, it is a idea to have her use a Mystic Heal Berry as it will only deplete 1 of your stock, but provide the healing benefit to all characters.  Grudiev will be fairly simple to take down.

Fengalon - Begin the battle by defending with all characters to minimize damage from the Hi-Speed Ripper attack.  Fengalon has high RFX and will almost always get the first move each turn.  He is more dangerous than Grudiev, but he is susceptible to Earth magic, so ensure Gallows is equipped with the Terra Roar medium for access to the Petrify Arcana.  Because Fengalon will usually act before Virginia, heal as necessary anticipating the worst case scenario.  Again, attempt to get Virginia's FP above 25 so you can use a Mystic Heal Berry.

Schturdark - Defend with all characters on the first turn to minimize damage from Assault Tide.  Afterwards, ensure Gallows is equipped with the Gale Claw medium so he can use Inspire against Schturdark.  Schturdark will often heal after taking Arcana damage, but the net damage is still likely than Gallows will be able to deal with his ARM.  Look for an opportunity to Mystic Heal Berry with Virginia to preserve resources and this guardian should not be extremely challenging.

Moor Gault - Defend with all characters on the first turn to minimize damage from Vapor Blast.  Moor Gault is very weak to Refrigerate, so make sure Gallows is equipped with the Aqua Roar medium.  Keep HP high enough to avoid a deathblow and this battle will play out similarly to the other three.  Upon defeating Moor Gault, the achievement will unlock.
