Hello there, I'm Nepiki! I'm a gamer who has an unofficial case of amnesia so I have an obsession with writing everything down so I don't forget about it! Joking aside, I do genuinely like writing, especially if it helps out other people. I don't have a lot of guides yet, but expect to see more pop up in the future!

For everything me related, here are some links you can check out:

# 2) Introduction

Wendy: Every Witch Way is an action-platform video game published by TDK Mediactive and developed by WayForward Technologies for the Game Boy Color in 2001. The game centers on Wendy the Good Little Witch from the Casper the Friendly Ghost series. Wendy accidentally opens her aunts' chest containing magical stones, which upset the gravity of a floating castle that crashes on her house. The player controls Wendy through four worlds with sixteen levels, with each world having three side-scrolling levels and one horizontal shooter stage. Inserting the game in the Game Boy Advance unlocks a new world exclusive to the console.

The game was conceived as a tie-in for a planned reboot animated series. It received generally positive reviews from video game critics, praising it for its originality but received criticism for its short length. WayForward's Matt Bozon would later take inspiration from Wendy: Every Witch Way for their 2009 game Mighty Flip Champs. 

This achievement set was created by [televandalist](https://retroachievements.org/User/televandalist) and [Shmelyoff](https://retroachievements.org/User/Shmelyoff). I really likes this set quite a lot, because it allowed me to play this 30 minute, pathetically easy game in multiple different ways. Definitely one of my favourite sets I've played so far!

# 3) Walkthrough

[**Step 1: 5 stars Achievements**](#step-1-5-stars-achievements--total-points-170)

This basically comes down to a level-by-level walkthrough. Every level has at least 5 or more stars, that count as your hitpoints. Whenever you get hit, you lose 1 star and have to regain it before the end of the level. There are passwords for every level, so you can easily return to that level for these or other achievements.

[**Step 2: Game Clear Achievements**](#step-2-game-clear-achievements--total-points-170)

There are several achievements dedicated to beating the game in one setting. You can get them all at once on Hard mode, but you can also decide to do them on Normal mode first. The difference between Normal and Hard is that ----. A single playthrough lasts slightly longer than half an hour.

[**Step 3: Miscellaneous Achievements**](#step-3-miscellaneous-achievements--total-points-110)

Miscellaneous achievements that usually ask you to play the game in a slightly different way than you've been doing (no usage of the wand etc.)

Pretty straightforward level. There are only 5 stars here, so be sure to collect them all. They're all on the route to the end. Jump before gravity switching to ensure there's no enemy that can hit you.

_Complete World 1 Bonus Stage with 5 Stars_

Since you can't view the entire screen, it's best to stay somewhere in the middle so you can see where the stars are, but most tend to be near the bottom. Near the end, there are 2 at the bottom. Be careful of enemies going upwards.

2-1 is a single route to the end, with more than 5 on the way. This shouldn't be too difficult, but do watch out for the jumping slimes and toxic going along with gravity switching.

Multiple stars on the way to the end, but be careful whenever there are bushes around. Make sure there are no enemies inside, otherwise a spear will go up and maybe catch you off-guard. After the bushes are done, there's one more star to get.

It can be a tricky stage with the many jumping slimes, but there are multiple stars to recover yourself if you lose one. Be extra careful near the end though, as the enemy with the bomb can be particularly nasty. Once he drops the bomb, flip gravity so that he kills himself.

It's best to stay in the middle, but most stars in this stage are on the higher half. You'll find more than 5 there, so you should get it if you stay at the top.

Multiple stars to get, especially near the halfway point where there's a long vertical shaft with multiple. Just be sure to flip gravity back before you hit the end, otherwise you'll have to deal with spikes and lose your chance. Near the end, be sure to walk on the ceiling so you don't have to worry about any of those spiked block enemies.

3-2 is one of the few stages with multiple pathways. The lower pathway does have more stars and is perhaps also the easier one--just watch out for the spikes near the beginning of this pathway. For the end, take care of the skeletons, then walk on the ceiling, drop down and you're done.

3-3 has quite a lot of stars, especially near the beginning but also near the middle with a room of 4 stars total. Given that there are a lot of stars after it at well, this stage most likely won't give you trouble--just beware of the red spiky enemy at the end.

Stay in the middle to get a good idea of where all the stars are. Most are near the middle/bottom. Watch out for the enemies going upwards.

Most of 4-1's stars are near the beginning, so gather them all and avoid damage as much as possible. The final elevator room only has 1 star which is very risky to get, so it's best to get 5 before then.

4-2 has a total of four stars in the final section with the vertical shaft and floating bottles. If you have at least one before then, you're golden. Get 5 at the start, and you'll be fine as this level is pretty easy.

This one is very easy, because there's a long horizontal hallway near the end with tons of stars. When falling, strafe to the right first, then to the left, then choose either direction and you should easily have 5 stars.

At the end of the stage right before the boss, there are 4 stars close to each other to grab. This means that you only need to worry about having at least 1 star before reaching that point. The boss itself is very easy; just go to the top or bottom and stay there until he fires a green stone, fire it back and flip gravity to hit him, then go nuts with the wand.

_Complete Advance World 1 with 5 Stars_

The amount of stars is limited to 5 or 6, so get them all. Enemies aren't your problem here, as spikes will be. You're forced to do a no-death, no-damage run here. Do be careful with ghosts and if you can avoid all spikes, the achievement is yours.

?-2 has a good amount of stars, but it stops right after the final two at the spikes section. From there on out, you're on your own. Be careful with the red spiky enemies and remember that they can bounce, so use that to your advantage.

?-3 also has enough stars, but there's only one to get right before the end. Be sure to have at least four before you reach the final red spiky enemies. Before that point, there are several other red spiky enemies as well. Remember that they bounce, and use that to your advantage. The final two red spiky enemies can be annoying as you have to jump and then gravity switch in midair, but these will be your final obstacles.

_Complete all stages in one session on any difficulty (No Password)_

This achievement speaks for itself: beat the game in one session on any difficulty. If you're planning to go for 100%, you can do this achievement on the hard difficulty to score the achievements for that difficulty as well.

***

_Clear the game on any difficulty without using a continue_

Beat the game on any difficulty without losing all of your lives. You have a total of 5 lives, most likely 6 given the amount of points you get. Given how easy this game is, it really should not be a problem on normal difficulty. However, you can obtain this achievement on Hard difficulty, where you might immediately unlock the achievement for that difficulty as well. For a slightly more detailed roadmap, refer to _Hard Game Clear (Deathless)_.

_Clear the game on any difficulty without losing a life_

Beat the game on any difficulty without losing a single lives. Every enemy and obstacle do one hit, so be sure to pick up every star you come across. For bonus stages, stick to the top-half of the screen when having at least one star as you're least likely to get hit there. If you do this achievement on Hard difficulty, you unlock this one as well as the achievement for doing it on hard. For a slightly more detailed roadmap, refer to _Hard Game Clear (Deathless)_.

_Clear the game on hard without using a continue_

Beat the game on hard without losing all of your lives. You have a total of 5 lives, most likely 6 given the amount of points you get. Keep in mind however, that you die in one hit from touching spikes. These are in fair spots, but it's good to keep in mind. For a slightly more detailed roadmap, refer to _Hard Game Clear (Deathless)_.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/76260.png) [Hard Game Clear (Deathless) (50)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/71291)   
_Clear the game on Hard without losing a life_

Beat the game on hard without losing a single life. Possibly the hardest achievement in the game but due to the low difficulty and short playthrough of the campaign, this is easily doable. One thing you have to keep in mind above all else, is that you die in one hit from spikes which will immediately ruin your playthrough. Spikes are overall very predictable on where they are placed even if they are off-screen, but here are a few tips and nasty spikes that you want to keep in mind:

- You will almost be guaranteed to never even come close to the time limit, so take your time for this achievement. Playing it safe is key.
- For every bonus level, grab at least one star and stick to the top-half of the screen as there are less enemies there.
- Be careful with the spikes at the end of 2-3.
- 3-2 has a good amount of spikes, but the safest route is taking the left path. Be sure to grab as many stars as you can and kill every enemy in front of you, and the damage should be of no importance.
- 3-3 is where the spikes amount really starts to increase. If you're careful, it still shouldn't be too bad. However, you are going to have to shift gravity in the air multiple times, so be sure you have mastered that.
- 4-1 is not too bad with spikes, but has a semi-difficult part at the end with the elevator enemies that you have to travel upside-down on.
- 4-3 is, unsurprisingly, the hardest stage in the main game and has quite a lot of nasty spike placements. To name a few: Close to the beginning with the two pits (fall down in the first one, then jump up and reverse gravity to get to the ceiling). After the bombing enemies is probably the nastiest spike of them all, as you have to travel on the ceiling first, then make your way up and immediately gravity switch. You can potentially damage boost from the skeleton which means you don't have to gravity switch, but I wouldn't risk it. Right before the final vertical shaft is an annoying spike on the floor which requires a bit of precision. After that, the achievement is pretty much yours as the boss is pathetic.

_Clear Advance World (No Password)_

This achievement speaks for itself: beat the advance levels in one session. The only difficulty available for these levels is Hard, so you might die occasionally from the big amount of spikes. If you're not going for the deathless achievement, you don't have to worry about dying and just about beating the levels however.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/76262.png) [Advance Witch Way Deathless (25)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/71293)   
_Clear Advance World without losing a life_

This can be a difficult achievement due to the big amount of spikes, but they are yet again very fair and predictable. Here are a few things to keep in mind:

- One playthrough is about 10 minutes.
- You most likely still don't have to worry about the time limit, which is generous.
- 4-1 has a lot of spikes, but this is exactly what I mean by it being predictable because every time there's an open space, you can go down or up. Take it slow and you'll be fine, but watch out for a select few spikes that are close to the ceiling.
- 4-2 has almost no spikes except near the end. Be extra careful here as they are close to each other.
- 4-3 has two main obstacles: the red spiky enemies, and every vertical shaft having spikes on both walls. For the enemies, do remember that they bounce when they hit the floor, and use that to your advantage. For the latter, you'll be fine as long as you have a good sense of staying exactly in the middle. If you can deal with this, you'll be perfectly fine. However, there's one nasty spike to keep in mind that are only very barely visible on screen, which is beyond the two elevator enemies and the two vertical shafts with spikes. Get on the ceiling and then jump upside-down on the block to make it past safely.

_Clear 4-1, 4-2 and 4-3 without using your wand_

Probably sounds like a set of menacing achievements, but they're actually pretty easy--especially on normal mode. Just get your life count up with stars and avoid enemies, that's all there is to it. Dying will not ruin progress on the achievement, and every enemy except for some in world 4 are avoidable. In case of the world 4 enemies, just damage boost through them.

_Have 6 Lives_

This should come inevitably when you're going for the no-deaths achievements but if you are not: a new life is granted at 20000 points. It takes a while before you reach that amount if you're starting from the first level (somewhere around the 3rd world), and you also need to avoid dying before then. The only way to get score is from killing enemies and gathering stars, so take your time to explore everything a stage has to offer and then move on. The bonus stages are especially useful for getting your score up as there's a lot of enemies.

**Minimum number of shifts: 13**

Go to the ceiling right away and make your way down, which are both 2 mandatory gravity shifts. 1 mandatory shift follows to make your way down to the bottom of the red-yellow platforms. Stay on the ceiling here. Everything till the end of this hallway can be done while staying on the ceiling. 2 mandatory gravity shifts follow to make your way to the top, but yet again, stay on the ceiling because the end of this hallway can also be done that easily. 1 mandatory shift is required to get up again, and make your way to the top. Walk forward a bit here, then use 1 gravity switch to get on the upside-down platform with the star, then use 1 more mandatory shift to jump through the red-yellow platform at the end. Stay on the ceiling until the end, and then perform the following 5 mandatory shifts which bring you to the end of the stage.

Jump on the platforms, and get on the highest one with the spike which you can barely make. Continue your path, with your first 4 gravity switches being at the spikes under the red-yellow platform. Fall down the vertical shaft, and use 2 gravity shifts to make your way up and down again. At the room with the two wizards, jump on the highest platform and keep moving forward, no shifts needed. When you're at another red-yellow platform, take the entrance on the second left which requires another 2 gravity shifts. Jump over the spikes, and do 1 gravity switch to make the red spike enemy go up. Make your way forward and you're at the end.

**Minimum number of shifts: 9**

The first half of the stage is really easy. Jump to the middle of the pit while killing the ghost, jump to the opposite and continue your path. The 1st gravity switch is near the "stairs" with spikes, with the 2nd one being right after to go down a vertical shaft. Jump on the platform and make your way to the split path. The path you want to take here is the one on the right.

Here is where it gets slightly tricky; you have to jump over the spikes ahead of you, which is pretty pixel-perfect. Succeed, go down and the next 2 gravity shifts are mandatory. This brings you to a room with two skeletons and two spiked blocks in the middle and as you might have guessed, you can jump between there. It's tricky, but doable. After that room, there are 2 mandatory shifts again in vertical shafts, and 2 more after in the room with the platforms and spiky enemies. Once you're on the top platform, gravity shift 1 last time and make your way right to the goal.

This will probably take a few retries, but the pattern is pretty obvious once you see it. Start from the middle until you have two stars, then make your way gradually to the right and collect two stars on the far right here as well, and then gradually to the left where there are two at the far left as well. Make your way to the middle again, then choose either side and you're done. If you do miss a star, you can't obtain the achievement anymore. The fastest way to get back here is to kill yourself by shifting gravity and running into the enemies in the middle, as it will bring you to a decently close checkpoint.

_Clear the first world without picking up any stars and without dying_

A pretty easy achievement, just take your time and you'll be perfectly fine.

1-1: Travel on the ceiling for the first part so you don't have to deal with any stars. The only thing you have to worry about is the purple enemy, but he won't cause much trouble.       
1-2: The opposite of 1-1, stay on the floor and yet again, be wary of purple enemies. Most stars here are not on the main road so you don't have to worry about them.      
1-3: Patience is key; wait for the snails to move, then kill them. Yet again, not many of the stars are on the main road.      
1-4: Most of the stars are at the bottom, so fly to the top of the screen. The enemies are far easier to deal with higher up anyway.

Switch gravity right from the start and make your way to the ceiling, after which the floating bottle will revert gravity and makes you able to jump up. Keep making your way forward and don't change gravity when you see the next bottle, as it will do exactly what you want for you while you keep moving forward. When you're at the bottom of the vertical shaft, go to the ceiling and continue your way, damage boosting through that... eye thing. At the next bottle, wait 1 second with jumping as it will then flip gravity. Go to the top left and wait for it to shift gravity again so you can jump up. Shift gravity again so you can make your way up. This is the first checkpoint, but don't die as the checkpoint will automatically set you at 199 seconds.

When at the top, shift gravity so you're on the ground and take the top road with the enemies. After killing the enemy, wait at the end of the platform for the bottle to shift gravity again. Jump over the spikes and quickly make your way to the block so that you won't get shifted into the spikes. Keep making your way down, but let the bottles do the gravity shifting work for you. When at the bottom, make sure you're walking on the floor. Platform on two of the elevator enemies, then shift gravity making you stand under the second block. Jump under the elevator, then make a small jump and shift gravity and your goal is in sight.

TL;DR: Make the floating bottles do most of the work for you.
