# Overview

### The achievements can be grouped into a few types.

- Story Achievements (these cannot be missed.)
- Trading related (ALL of these are missable, be sure to check the `Digimon Center` every time you progress thru the story).
- Digi-Beetle parts (Buy/find the Digi-Beetle parts, and fully upgrade them).
- Digivolutions (Recruit or Digivolve into specific Digimon).

### General Tips / Walkthrough notes for missables

- Any team is fine. It only affects the beginning of the game.
- Be sure to check the `Digimon Center` every time you progress thru the story, and try to trade them as soon as possible.
- When you reach `Disk Domain`, be prepared for the "Angemon's Gift" missable achievement.
- When you reach `BIOS Domain`, be prepared for the "MetalGreymon" missable achivement.
- The `BIOS Domain` is also your final chance at trading the `ToyAgumon` for `SnowAgumon` missable achievement.
    - This achievement can be a problem if you did not join `Gold Hawk` (as you need to recruit `ToyAgumon`).
    - Save up the `Toy Car` you find and use those. You can find more in `BIOS Domain`.
    - Or if you don't care about keeping the `SnowAgumon`, you can use the `Toy Plane` that you received from an NPC, then reload from save.
- When you reach `Device Dome`, you will gain access to buy the `PegasusEG1`. Keep this engine and fully upgrade it before selling, for the "Pegasus Engine" missable achievement.
- When you reach `File Island`, the first domain there is `Power Domain`. Be prepared for the "Jurassic Park" achievement.
    - If you don't have a team, just recruit `Monochromon, Greymon and Tyrannomon` in this domain, train them up a few levels, bring some healings and you should be fine. The boss is only 1 single `M-Tyrannomon`.
- When you reach `Core Tower`, make sure you are prepared for the missable "Proven Your Worth" achievement.
- Continue until you beat the game, watch the credits, and you will be back to the world. Complete the rest of your achievements via the final `Tera Domain` grind.
- The final grind will be recruiting every Digimons listed in the achievements set. Most can be found in the `Tera Domain`. Some of them are very hard or impossible to recruit, so manually digivolving them might be easier.
- Tips for `I-dramon`
    - Recruit the following: 1x `WarGreymon`, 1x `Airdramon`, 7x `Greymon`.
    - DNA `Airdramon` + `Greymon` = `Veemon`.
    - Level him up into Champion, then immediately DNA with `Greymon` back into `Veemon` to increase its DP.
    - When you reach DP 7, DNA the `Flamedramon` with `WarGreymon` back into `Veemon`.
    - With a DP 8 `Veemon`, level him up into Mega. You will get `Flamedramon`, `Raidramon`, and `I-dramon` in one go.
- Tips for `Omnimon, Baihumon and Diaboromon`
    - Recruit `Triceramon` and DNA them into `Tyrannomon` over and over again, to build up your DP.
    - At DP 18, DNA the `MasterTyrannomon` + `WarGreymon` back into `Tyrannomon`.
    - With a now DP 19 `Tyrannomon`, level up into Mega to get `WarGreymon`.
    - DNA the `WarGreymon` + `Machinedramon` = `MetalGreymon`.
    - At DP 20, `MetalGreymon` will digivolve into `Omnimon` (achievement pop!).
    - DNA the `Omnimon` + `M-Garurumon` = `Meteormon`.
    - `Meteormon` will digivolve into `Baihumon` (achievement pop!).
    - DNA the `Baihumon` + `GranKuwagamon` = `Okuwamon`.
    - `Okuwamon` will digivolve into `Diaboromon` (achievement pop!).
