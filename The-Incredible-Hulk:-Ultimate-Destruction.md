# Introduction
This guide will go through every single achievement on the set made by MGNS8M for this game. In the first part it will have a walkthrough of all the achievements for smooth collecting. And then for the second part I will give tips for each and every achievement on the set.

## Achievements
There are a total of 26 story missions in this game. The set has an achievement for every story mission for hard mode and normal mode. So you will get a total of 52 achievements for just completing the story in normal and on hard. Plus 7 more for every chapter completed in normal mode. That makes it 59 achievements. Then for completing 1 gallery of comic book you will get an achievement and you have to complete 6 of them. Now it comes to 65. And for buying all the moves you will get 5 achievements. That makes it a total of 70 achievements. And last but not least the jump points achievements there are 2 of them so that makes the total tally 72. 

# Part 1: Guidethrough

## Step 1: Story Part 1 and Jump Points (First Playthrough)
This game has a pretty average length for a story. It's not too long and it's not too short. It's just the right amount. The normal mode achievements say you will get them if you complete them in either normal or hard. You might be thinking "I can just play the hard mode first so I can get both of those achievement together!" Well there's a problem hard mode doesn't unlock until you beat the main story once in normal or easy. So that's that. After completing the first mission unlock all the jump points in the city and then the badlands with the image I provide in the guide below. Then just keep playing the main story until you finish the mission My Other Voice. Then next step comes in.

## Step 2: Collectibles
This game has a really sweet amount of collectibles. They are scattered across both the City and the Badlands. There are a total of 60 of them. You will only unlock one of those achievements until you finish that gallery. Just follow the collectible video I link below this guide. In that video I will be going through all those collectibles by order in that gallery. You might ask "But why until 'My Other Voice'?". Well that's because after that mission every comic book becomes available to be collected because before that you would be missing like 4 or 5 comic books if you tried to collect them all before.

## Step 3: Story Part 2 (First Playthrough)
Now that you have all the comic books under your belt. It's time to finish the normal mode playthrough of the story.

## Step 4: Story and remaining moves (Second Playthrough)
After you have finished the story go inside the church and choose replay story in hard mode. This will start the hard mode playthrough. Just finish it like the normal mode playthrough except this time no collectibles are stopping you. So breeze through the story and buy the remaining moves you need to unlock all of the moves-related achievements. And then you will get your coveted mastery of this game!

This mission is really not hard. You just need to be careful and quick. After following the helicopter to know the location. Use Atomic Slam if you have it to break them or if you don't just punch them. If you are in your first playthrough don't try to take those helicopter down. You don't have Hulk's dangerous moves yet. Or if you are on a second playthrough just Super Air Strike and Cyclone Skyjack that thing! Then Scram!

This mission will seem very hard if you don't know what you are doing. But fortunately you do! Get Steel Fists as early as possible. Get some nice gauntlets for yourself then wreck those pesky tanks with your charged attacks! If you do this correctly and are quick to dodge their shots this mission will be a walk in the park even on a first playthrough! Also if you are on a later playthrough it's really not worth it to Hammer Toss it just takes too much time and keeps Hulk vulnerable for too long to take damage.

For the CAT Scan machine part there will only be humans with rockets surrounding it. They may not seem much but those continuous rocket damage adds up over time. So just be wary of them but don't go out of your way to defeat them as they will respawn again. Use Atomic Slam if you have it or just punch around when you get scram and use the nearest jump point you have to deliver it to the church. If you have unlocked all the jump points earlier you will have one jump point near every objective very close to you ready to help you leave. In the hydraulic lift part use Atomic Slam or punch the building with charged attacks and steel fists to quickly put it down to the ground there will be another obstacle destroy that too take the hydraulic lift then scram. Now for the Substation Generator it will be surrounded by a shield so chuck some cars at it while in the air. Don't try to use poles they will do very little damage or throwing cars from the ground as the machine is surrounded by generators chances you will be you will miss due to them. For Hydraulic lift and Substation Generator there will be more troops and helicopters ready for you. So leave as quickly as possible after getting it. On second playthrough even if you are more powerful than before destroying the army isn't worth it as they will respawn.

Abomination isn't that hard here. Note the word here. You will get why later. Use every move you got on him. Every combo and melee move. As it will hit him for the first time. But if you try to hit him again with those same moves he will block you. Don't jump around as he will slam you against the will with his unavoidable move. Throw only big stuff at him. It will only work for the first time. So keep varying your moves and he will be down in no time. Stay away from the walls as both of you together or either of you can get buried underneath the rubble and both of you will take damage. So be careful.

This mission is not hard. There will be just tanks and humans. Since you are in the desert you won't have much cars to get Steel Fists. So use your charged attacks to dispatch the tanks or if you have one. Wreck it! But destroy the satellites quickly because the army respawns.

Use the traversal tip I have in the tips section and catch up to them really fast and wreck it with Dashing Straights or just punches. But be really wary of the helicopters and tanks. They will juggle you around if you are not careful. Don't get caught up with them as the convoy is pretty fast and will gain great distance if you don't deal with them. For the first two convoys there will only be tanks and helicopters. But in the last one a mech will come by. Headbutt him and flail him around or if you have powerful moves. Gamma Bomb that B*.

</pre></big>

This mission is easy if you are careful. At first a mech will chase you around headbutt him and deal with him or play with him with your powerful moves. Then destroy the machines to take down the shield and get inside that part of the base. Quickly go deeper and then destroy those two mechs. If you get surrounded by mechs they WILL overwhelm you. So knock them down to get yourself some breathing room and deal with them one by one. After that get the mech part after grabbing that mech suit. Then quickly make a run. If you get knocked down by those mechs don't try to run as they have pesky move that will knock you out wherever you are. Deal with that B* take the part then run and jump as fast as you can. And soon you will be home.

</pre></big>

Destroy the satellites quickly as possible because if they are around the Hulkbuster can call in reinforcements as mechs. Since there are plenty of cars around you can get steel fists and destroy them quickly. Then throw stuff at the Hulkbuster or punch him if you get the chance and he will be down. Take down his missile pods quickly as you will get a bit more breathing room since he will spam that stuff if he has it. You can target those after locking in on him then flicking the right stick to the right or left.

You will be able to fight the ambush pretty easily. At this point you will have Cyclone Skyjack and Super Air Strike unlocked. So buy them and jets and helicopters won't be any worry for you anymore. The Combat Warden can give some challenge but super air strikes or dashing uppercuts just makes him helpless to be comboed. Same goes for the patrol units. But they can be gamma quake'd.

This is probably one of the easiest mission later in the story. Just keep following the truck and throwing stuff at it. Eventually the electricity will die out and you can scram with it.

She's probably the second hardest boss in the game. But if you know what you are doing it will be easy. Keep dodging everything she throws at you. Then after she executes one of her long starting attacks dashing straight her and wail her. In the 2nd phase of the fight you have to be careful because she will do tremendous amount of damage even in normal mode if you get hit. So be careful.

</pre></big>

Unlike some missions here if you defeat the mechs they won't respawn. So you have to first take them out then throw the gas pod. To destroy the hulkbuster destroyers quickly use the elbow drop. They do massive amounts of damage to them. And deal with the smaller mechs normally. Then throw the gas pod in the river. You can throw the gas pod faster if you throw it while in the air. But be sure to near the coastline of the ocean.

Use my traversal tip and go to the point. Pursue the helicopter then when you get the chance take it down with cyclone skyjack and super air strike. Take the Uranium and scram to the church with the nearest jump point. Easy.

Since this is an escort mission in a good hulk game. Don't expect it to be bad. It's actually fun and fair and even has checkpoints. Deal with every enemy type with the weakness I have given in that section and it will be a breeze.

Ross really loves his underofficers so if you toss a tank with the hammer toss. He will take emotional damage alongside mech damage. And the fight will be over. Be careful of his lasers though they will not be merciful to you even in normal mode.

Pretty easy mission at the start. But man that Chief Warden is a pain in the a** during the first playthrough. Because he ignores every attack you throw at him. Critical attacks don't deal much damage to him too. So you will have to throw stuff and take health from the reinforcements he calls and critical pain him and he will go down.

A VERY easy mission. After getting out be sure to destroy the missile trucks first. They will juggle you with their missiles. By then you will have missile pack weaponize. So take those missile packs they drop and erase those tanks and missile trucks. The jets can be bit trick but you will eventually be able to skyjack them. Be sure to destroy the missile trucks first. Because if you focus on the jets first. They will killbox you in that first zone. After that it's just a breeze.

This mission is a bit challenging if you don't know what you are doing. You probably won't have any trouble with the truck part. Most of the trouble comes in from the second part. The trick is to just be fast, knock down mechs to get some space, grab one and toss them to those shield machines. Then you will be free as a kite. Take the machine and scram to the church. And it's over.

In this mission multiple tanks, mechs and specifically 2 Titans the ones that you face in turning point will appear. Tear through tanks with steel fists as there are plenty of cars. Gamma Grind those mechs and if you leave some tanks. Toss them to the titans. And critical pain them if you have health. And you will be done. Those jets at the start can be taken down easily with skyjack.

Devil Hulk ain't that hard as he looks. Just be sure to dodge his hand sweeps and mouth sweeps around those mirrors and you will be golden. Cannonball the rock pillars he erects then punch the mirrors and run. That's the game here. When he comes out punch him and if you manage to have much health critical pain him and he will go down easily. Depending on how you play Devil Hulk go back to the hole like 3 to 5 times.

Unlike how the mission tells you. You don't have to follow Abomination all the way. You have to fight twice in his way. So just don't worry about him. He will even wait for you in the points both of you will fight. Critical pain him and don't stay close to him as he will unleash a very devastating attack towards you if you stay close to him. Missile Packs eats his health. So make sure to use them accordingly. After the last encounter with him he will jump out to oblivion. Due to the mission depending on his location. His pathing might break so you might have to restart the mission if you are unlucky. But it's a fairly simple mission.

Now's the endgame. You will probably have to retry a bunch of times but you will pass it eventually. Don't try to fight him head on as he will annihilate you with his high powered attacks. Instead attack and elbow drop him when he is not paying attention to you. He will lose interest in you when he is destroying the generators. When he is and the generators are exposed and he is trying to break it. Keep a big object and smash express behind him. He will stumble on the generator and he will lose a lot of health. Keep elbow dropping him and that will take away most of his health. That's the name of the game. Occassionally attack him when he is busy. Stumble him to a generator and watch him fry.

You don't need any tip here. Buy must buy moves first and the not needed ones later and you will get these cheevos eventually. You cannot get all of them on a first playthrough.

# Part 3: Collectible

# Part 4: Tips

* You see the dash hulk does when you press the sprint button? You might think that might be for some damage. And you would be correct but that is not only for damage. You see if you do a max charge jump during that dash animation. Hulk will do a long jump. He will cover much greater distance than he would if he jumps while normally sprinting.

# Part 5: Enemy Types

* Humans : These things should cower if you just so much as stand near them. Their whole existence is their weakness.

* Rocket Equipped Humans : You canno take them lightly. If a group of them gangs up on you they will melt your healthbar. So take them out one by one just like you would a normal human enemy.

* Tanks : A Challenge at first but helpless after you get some moves. Steel Fists and slightly charged Dashing Uppercut OHKO's them. Even hammer without steel fists does a lot of damage. And they are dead as soon as you start hammer tossing them. They can shoot cannons and charge at you if you stand infront of them.

* Missile Trucks : A Slighly charged dashing uppercut without steel fists OHKO's them. They can juggle you with their missile flurry. Or knock you back with their homing missiles. Those homing missiles are a pain in the a**. They really do find their target eventually just when you think you dodged it.

* Mechs : Challenge at first, fodder later. Helpless if you dashing uppercut them and tornado frenzy them. Or gamma bomb, grind or quake them as they can be grabbed whenever you want. They can punch you, charge at you in the air, combo at you a little bit and do a rocket flurry if they grab you and deal a lot of damage than they should. They can also break out of your grab if you hold them for too long.

* Warden Patrol Units : Pretty much same as Normal Mechs but they break out much faster, are faster in general and deal a lot more damage. They do pretty much the same attacks as the mechs. And the normal weaknesses apply on them too.

* Helicopters : They should scare you in the first part of the game. But they should be scared of YOU later. A Super Air Strike or a cannonball and then a Skyjack will put them down for good. They fire missiles and gatling gunfire.

* Jets : They may seem scary but since they show up later in the game when you have the powerful moves they don't impact as much as helicopters. Same strategy applies to them as helicopters but one extra fun thing applies to them. You can fool them by doing a slow air strike they will think you are gonna hit them so they will do a evasive manuever in place giving you time to SUPER AIR STRIKE them and Skyjack them down. They shoot missiles in specific runs mostly together with their flying partner. So a skyjack and a target kick can help you take two birds down with one of those birds.

* Hulkbuster Destroyer : They may seem scary since they were a boss in Chapter 2. But since they show up as regular enemies their health pool is much lower than them as boss. They will spam missiles and sweep you if you are near them. You can cheese them if you are near a wall with elbow drops. One elbow drop and they will stagger HARD. Then you can air dash to the wall and keep elbow dropping him. This melts their health bar in 5 seconds while also taking out anything else in the area of effect of the elbow drop.

# Part 6: Upgrades

* Steel Fists = A must buy. Adds a lot of damage to your base attacks!

* Dashing Straight = May seem like a great move but is a bit of a nuisance. Mainly because it knocksback the opponent. Since the enemies get up really quick in this game so there's no point in using this other than on opponents who can't be knocked or buildings. Even there uppercut is much better.

* Air Recovery = MUST BUY. This thing will save your ass countless of times.

* Running Grab = This should be one of the base abilities. As you will be running a lot so there should be no doubts about buying this one.

* Ground Smash = Great at first. But quickly becomes obsolete later. As the animation takes too long. And it doesn't cover much area. Critical counterpart is awesome though.

* Backhand = No specific benefit. But it's only 500 points. So should be comfortable in the backpocket.

* Punt Kick = Does a good amount of damage but takes a long time to startup.

* Sonic Clap = Good area of effect move. But takes a bit of time to start.

* Air Stomp = Not so much useful for combat. Since you can't target it. But useful for traversal because you can drop straight down with this. But still does a good amount of damage.

* Smash Express = Basically being able to Smash while dashing with objects. A pretty meh kind of upgrade but don't underestimate it. It will save your a** in the final mission.

* Double Fist Toss = Basically the ability to throw while dashing.  A kinda must buy since you will be throwing a lot of stuff. Might as well have the ability to do so while dashing.

* Critical Atomic Slam = Coolest Move in the game. Does a really good amount of damage. Has a pretty wide area of effect. A must buy for hairy situtations.

* Slam Kick = You won't be using this move much. I call this kind of move a kind of flair move. But still does a really good amount of damage to helicopters or jets.

* Shield = You better buy this because aside some enemies who can grapple attack you they seem to ignore the shield. But this thing can help you cheese some bosses with this. Like the hulkbuster destroyer as the boss.

* Shockwave Smash = Good for dealing extra damage to tanks. Looks cool. Not much else.

* Air Dash = Hulk's tool to never touching the ground. Well the super variant actually. But it's a stepping stone!

* Dashing Sonic Clap = I don't remember how many times I normal sonic clapped, even so dashing sonic clapped. So ain't much useful but might help if you are trying to hit a group while running.

* Tornado Uppercut = This thing will make every Hulk size enemies helpless then the next move comes.

* Tornado Frenzy = And this will probably act as a finisher or a damage dealer to the Tornado Uppercut.

* Rapid Punch Burst = Hulk does this to Abomination in Chapter 1. So you can do it in game too now! Does a good amount of damage and looks very cool.

* Critical Thunder Clap = If I seem very disinterested in the Sonic Clap. Well that's because this one captivated me over that one. This one has a much wide area of effect and good damage and clears anything hulk has around him. And bonus points for the Vaccum like effect hulk does when starting it.

* Power Surge Level 1 = No reason to not get it.

* Club Smash = Basically a Ground Smash for clubs or poles. Poles in general don't deal a lot of damage but have a very large area of effect.

* Rising Upper = This one is a bit trickier and a bit slower uppercut. Deals good damage. Nice launcher too.

* Air Ground Slam = So you can fulfil all your air falling rock dreams. Seriosuly this one is much better than the grounded slam. That thing leaves Hulk exposed. This one doesn't and has the benefit of the ground one.

* Air Sonic Clap = Like Air Ground Slam but for Sonic Clap. Good area clearer in the air.

* Missile punchback = You won't be doing this intentionally at all. It will happen randomly when you don't expect. Mostly when you are hammer tossing the tank will automatically punchback for you.

* Headbutt = The mech's worst nightmare. Does a lot of damage than it should.

* Air Critical Atomic Slam = If Air Ground Slam fulfilled your falling rock dreams. This one will be your falling NUKE dreams. Seriously hulk drops like a nuke while he does this.

* Air Enemy Grapple = A very useful move against those mechs. You can grapple them with Super Air Strike and then gamma bomb or do whatever you want.

* Spear Impale = It's like punchback you won't be doing it intentionally. But when you pull this off you will definitely go "WHOOOAH" like I was when If first did this. If you throw this to a hulk sized enemy and he is near a wall he will get pinned to the wall like a dart. And if he isn't near a wall it will impale him and he will be stunned for a very long time. Of all the club and pole moves this is the most useful.

* Dashing Uppercut = The tanks, missile trucks worst and mech's second worst nightmare. OHKO's tanks and missile trucks and launches mechs for combos.

* Bowling = This is a weaponization move. So you will have to get a spherical object. You might think "Maybe bowling will do very huge amount of damage!". It doesn't. But it's smash option has a very nice area of effect!

* Cyclone Skyjack = The jet and helicopter pilots are gonna be crying when you pull this off to all of their teammates. You basically drag the aerial vehicles down with your weight. They will spin uncontrollably and fall to their definite demise.

* Dashing Ground Slam = Dashing counterpart of Ground Slam. Could be of use to groups while running.

* Gamma Quake = The first upgrade to Hulk's Triangle Attack. Does a LOT of damage to any foe that can be grabbed.

* Elbow Drop = Those hulkbuster destroyers are puny against this move. They can't do anything but watch as you drain their healthbars.

* Floor Kick = Actually a rage move. I use this when a enemy pisses me off. Hulk will stomp the enemy then kick him across.

* Critical Mass Surge Level 1 = Why wouldn't you?

* Shield Grind = A very cool move but one that doesn't deal a lot of damage.

* Hitchhike = Hulk can latch onto enemies bigger than him punching them. They will eventually shake him off. Biggest candidates are Abomination and Hulkbuster Destroyers.

* Super Air Dash = This adds onto Hulk's already pretty great traversal abilities.

* Shockwave Smash Repeater = Hulk can keep doing the super shockwave smash. This can juggle a lot of mech's together. So it's usefull in that regard. Other than that if there's just one enemy. You shouldn't even bother.

* Air Critical Thunder Clap = Critical Thunderclap but in the air. The tool you will probably use when you are in a tough situtation.

* Hammer Toss = Deal emotional damage to General Ross in turning point with this. He won't know what hit him and also other enemies. OHKO's most of them. As well as the tank you are tossing.

* Missile Pack Weaponize = A very useful weaponization. The missile packs that those missile trucks drop can be weaponized so you can fire the rockets yourself. These rockets OHKO's tanks and the missile trucks themselves. And eats Abomination's health bar in Hell Hath No Fury.

* Ball and Chain = A very cool weaponization but takes a lot of time to wind up when you attack far with it.

* Air Spike = Does a bit more damage than the drop kick does in the end of tornado frenzy.

* Target Kick = The tool kill a bird with another bird. Basically you can kick a aerial vehicle to another if you skyjack one of them.

* Gamma Grinder = As it says really grinds Hulk or lower size enemies.

* Critical Pain = The most powerful critical move in the game. Aside from some enemies this will melt a lot of enemies healthbars.

* Double Air Dash = As if Hulk wasn't fast already.

* Running Club Ram = Smash Express but for clubs and poles. You know what to do with it.

* Gamma Bomb = Do a quick grinder from the air on hulk or lower sized enemies. The more the height the more the damage.

* Air Cannnball = OHKO's missile trucks in normal mode. And does a lot of damage.

* Critical Mass Surge Level 2 = Hulk is gonna get another slot for another critical move.

* Super Shockwave Smash = Instead of three ways it will go five ways at the end of Shockwave Smash Repeater! More damage!

* Double Super Air Dash = Now Hulk is gonna fly.

* Power Surge Level 3 = More health never hurt anyone.
