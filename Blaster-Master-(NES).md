## **About**
This is **not** an official manual, official walk through or critical review. This document is a simple **guide** for the current achievement set available on [RetroAchievements](http://retroachievements.org/game/1459). This guide will give more information on earning the achievements, hash compatibility and any other necessary or useful information for the RA player.
## **Introduction**
_Blaster Master_ is a platform/run and gun shooter released by Sunsoft in 1988 for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Originally, it was released under the name _Ch√¥ Wakusei Senki Metafight_ in Japan, developed by Tokai Engineering. For the localized release, the plot was changed from your typical run and gun, space planetary defender storyline to a boy (Jason) on a mission to rescue his pet frog (Fred) from uncertain doom. The search for Fred underground leads to a bigger adventure, leaving Jason to go up against an alien force with an even sinister plan to invade and take over Earth. More specifically, Earth's radioactive plutonium waste is what is attracting this unknown, but evil force, multiplying the radioactive dangers already polluted by mankind. It's up to Jason to save his frog, Fred and the Earth.
## **Trivia**
_Blaster Master_ was included in _Worlds of Power_, a series of Scholastic book adaptions of localized NES games. The book added characters such as Eve, a humanoid alien heroine who lands on Earth, solely set on defeating the Plutonium Boss. Jason assists Eve by eradicating the aliens while Eve drives the Sophia 3rd. Other games novelized in the series are _Ninja Gaiden_, _Simon's Quest_, _Mega Man 2_, etc.

`Use Homing Missile` 

Classification: **Item based**

This achievement is unlocked when Sophia 3rd is equipped with this item and used. It shoots a homing missile by selecting this object on the inventory screen, then holding down and pressing the "B" button (while in the vehicle). It can either be picked up by the vehicle itself or by Jason on foot. Due to RAM instability, this is the among the trickiest of the easiest achievements in the entire game. You have to hold down the fire button until this unlocks (or repeatedly press fire).

`Maximize Hover Gauge`

Classification: **Item based**

Collect the "H" orbs dropped by enemies to fill Sophia 3rd's hover gauge. You must obtain the hover equipment first (see _Hovercraft_), which will allow the achievement to unlock (once the gauge is full). **It is possible to fill the gauge before you obtain the equipment, but the achievement cannot unlock without the equipment obtained.**

`Collect full ammo of Homing Missile (99)`

Classification: **Item based**

Maximize Homing Missiles ammo (99x) in your inventory. You can see the amount you are carrying by pressing start. There are two ways to achieve this: either enter and clear as many rooms with Jason on foot, or just simply don't use any special weapon ammo until this unlocks. Either way, you still have to pick up enough enemy drops to max out ammo.

`Sink Sophia into the abyss in Area 5.`

Classification: **Missable**

Jason has to swim his way through most of Area 5 to reach the boss. You can't get any further if you don't destroy the blocks, which prevent you from proceeding. Simply shoot with Sophia's Crush beam to destroy the blocks. You can either leave Sophia in that very same spot, or earn the achievement by dropping the vehicle into the opening where the blocks stood. **Keep in mind, if you do not bring Sophia in as deep as she can go, you would have to take a longer route when returning to the vehicle, after defeating the boss of this area.**

`Defeat all 7 Warlords`
