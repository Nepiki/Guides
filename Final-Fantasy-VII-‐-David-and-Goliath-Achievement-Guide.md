# Final Fantasy VII

## David and Goliath Achievement Guide

Hello everyone, I'm d13sel and I'm the author of this guide to obtain the achievement "David and Goliath" for Final Fantasy VII on RetroAchievements. In the past I've done quite a bit of speedrunning and challenges in FF7 and learnt a lot of strategies and mechanics so I've decided to write this guide up to help people with obtaining this achievement in a manner that minimizes time investment and difficulty, so I hope this helps.

## Acknowledgements
Firstly an acknowledgement should go to GarlandG for writing a low-level no materia guide which is available [here](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/197341-final-fantasy-vii/faqs/32536). There are a few strategies which I used in it but it was mostly the experience routing that I used for it rather than doing the calculations myself.

Secondly, the wider Final Fantasy VII community and the speedrunning community for helping me to learn the more in-depth mechanics and code as to how this game works. I don't go into detail here, but some of the knowledge from here has helped me to write the strategy for this guide.

## Preparation
Yes, I expect you to read this section.

While I want this challenge to be as easy as possible, beating the game at level 28 without grinding sources for 15 hours isn't exactly a walk in the park so I do need to cover some things. Also, I expect that you have finished FF7 before if you're doing this challenge and I won't be giving details on how to advance the story. If you want your hand held, hire an escort.
### ATB
The ATB is the mechanism which determines how quickly you get your turn, as well as the enemies that you are fighting. When the ATB advances depends on what setting you have enabled, and this is relevant in a lot of areas in this challenge.
1. **Active:** The ATB will always be advancing regardless of whether you are in a menu or the animation that is occurring during the battle. This is set during some bosses, but most aren't. Rather it is used when encountering random enemies to ensure the fastest possible escape.
2. **Recommended:** Garbage, don't ever use it.
3. **Wait:** The easy difficulty setting of the game. During certain animations (mostly magical, summons and limit breaks) the ATB will freeze, more importantly though, it will also freeze when you are in a menu in the battle, such as magic or item. This can be abused and I'll cover it in more detail on the relevant boss fights.

### Gil
Throughout most of this challenge, gil will be tight. Generally the earlier in the game it is, the tighter it will be. However as the game opens up (leaving Midgar, acquiring vehicles etc.) there are options for farming gil without killing enemies such as Steal materia. Just so you know though, Midgar is VERY tight and I wouldn't advise buying anything other than what I recommend in the guide.

### Pincers
Yeah pincers suck, especially in disc 2 and will result in death a lot of the time. I'm basing most of these from my memory but I'll notify when you are at risk of a pincer encounter. When there is a risk of a pincer, setting the ATB back to Wait can improve your chances of surviving (a little).

# The Actual Guide
## Midgar
At the start of the game, go into the settings and set ATB to **Active** and camera to **Fix** (this just makes choosing targets a little easier during the run). Pick up the two potions from the guard on the ground, fight the scripted battle, name your characters and head straight to Guard Scorpion. There is a **Phoenix Down** on the way to GS before the elevator if you'd like to pick it up but it isn't necessary.
### Guard Scorpion
**HP:** 800
**Difficulty:** "Attack while its tail's up"/10
**Party:** Cloud, Barret
**Survivor:** Cloud

You should use a calculator to be safe for this fight. This fight is basically fought normally, have Cloud cast Bolt and Barret attack in the four rounds of turns you get before it raises its tail. Cast Bolt once with the tail raised to charge Cloud and Barrets limits. Have Barret use a limit once then lower the HP so that Cloud can kill it. Kill Barret off then execute GS with Cloud.
**Note:** Cloud's max damage with Bolt is 98
Make like hay and bail out of the reactor and progress the story until you reach Sector 7, picking up another two potions on the way.

Progress through the story and go through the events in 7th Heaven bar. Once you've done that, head down to the weapon shop. Pick up the All materia and Ether on the upper floor where the tutorial characters reside, then go downstairs and do a shop. Sell your ethers and buy 21 grenades and customize their position to be first in your item menu. Now you have a choice, you can either learn some speed tech and skip about half an hour of the game by learning guard skip, or progress through the story normally, the skip progresses you all the way to Wall Market. If you don't do the skip, Air Buster is the only fight you take EXP from, and it goes to Barret.

After doing guard skip or completing story up to getting to Wall Market, proceed to the right into Wall Market. You'll be doing the dress sidequest in full getting the best items, there is a save point in Wall Market if you wish to save for safety. To do this, 
1. After going to the dress shop proceed into the materia store and talk to the cashier to start his item search
2. Go into the restaurant, sit down and eat a while, when they ask for feedback, tell them it tastes good (2nd option) and receive the **Coupon**
3. Go into the item shop, talk to the cashier and exchange the **Coupon** for the **Digestive**
4. Go down to the inn and stay the night, at the vending machine, buy the most expensive product for 200 gil
5. Go back to the materia store and give the item to the cashier, you'll receive the **Diamond Tiara**
6. Head into the bar and go up to the toilet and talk to the girl in there twice, give her the **Digestive** and you'll receive the **Sexy Cologne**
7. Talk to the dressmaker, pick the 2nd dialogue option both times when he asks what type of dress you want (I can't remember what they say)
8. Head back to the dress shop, talk to the dressmaker again and you'll receive the **Silk Dress**
9. Go into the gym, you must get more (a tie isn't good enough) squats than the opponent to receive the **Blonde Wig**

You should now have all 4 items, and can proceed to Corneo, note that you won't be able to save before Aps if you enter the mansion so safety save now if you choose. Pick up the ether and hyper in the mansion before going into the Aps fight, and give Restore materia to Aerith and set ATB to Wait.

### Aps
**HP:** 1800
**Difficulty:** 4/10
**Party:** Cloud, Tifa, Aerith
**Survivor:** Aerith
Again, you'll need a calculator for this fight. You'll need to do ~1660 damage before landing a killing blow with Aerith using a grenade to kill. Use grenades, Tifa and Cloud Limit Breaks and heal Aerith if she loses HP, remember to also count the self-inflicted damage to Aps from Tidal Wave which hits for ~180 when hitting his back and ~45 hitting his front. Not a difficult fight just don't lose count.

Don't bother with picking up the item to the left immediately after Aps, it's only a potion and isn't worth the extra encounter. Just heal Aerith, don't use up your Phoenix Downs here, set the ATB back to Active and head to the Train Graveyard, picking up **Steal** materia on the way. Don't worry about stealing ethers here unless you're already behind on gil for some reason, which are from Deenglows. Pick up the Hi-Potion and potions on the way through the graveyard.

Before talking to Barret, put Restore on Cloud and set the ATB back to Wait

### Reno
**HP:** 1000
**Difficulty:** 2/10
**Party:** Cloud, Tifa, Barret
**Survivor:** Cloud
A super easy fight, he'll die to 8 grenades, but if Cloud gets a Braver, use it in place of a grenade. Reno always opens the fight with Pyramid, best case is actually on Cloud as he'll damage down T and B nice and quickly but you have to destroy the pyramid before they both die. If he pyramids T or B, then destroy it so Reno can target them with physicals. Reno's Pyramid move is every 1st, 4th, 7th... etc turn. Wait for Reno to kill off T and B and execute with grenade/Braver after 7 grenades are thrown. Only heal Cloud after the fight, keep B and T dead.

In Sector 5, pick up the Ether and Cover materia in Aerith's garden and go through the cutscene with Elmyra. In the sector 5 shop, sell the Assualt Gun and all your ethers and buy as many grenades as you can (should be ~50) **BUT** make sure you have at least 300 gil left over. Buy the batteries and proceed to...

## Shinra Headquarters
In front of the entrance is a pretty good place to save, and now place Cloud in the back row. Take the stairs up to the 59th floor to avoid a bunch of fights (I've counted them, there are actually 59 flights of stairs...enjoy), pick up the Elixir on the way.
