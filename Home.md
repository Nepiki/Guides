**Welcome to the RetroAchievements guides wiki!**

## How to use it

1. Log into your github account (or [create an account](https://github.com/join) if you don't have one).
2. Go to [the wiki section of this repository](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/wiki).
3. Click on the New Page button (top right part of the page).
4. Create/edit your guide formatting it with [markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/). Alternatively, you can browse an existing guide by clicking edit in the top-right corner and then copying the contents to your own page, or use any of the following as base:
   * [Complete Guide Template](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/wiki/Achievement-Guide-template-(Full)), used for writing complete guides covering every achievement of a game.
   * [Simple Guide Template](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/wiki/Achievement-Guide-Template-(Simple)), best used for if you only want to describe parts of a game, like only the missables or a specific chapter or region of a game.
5. For the achievements within your guide, you can use either of the following to make it convenient for yourself and just focus on writing:
   * [Achievement Block Generator](https://raguides-template-generator.vercel.app/), to convert all of the achievements of a set into achievement code blocks that can easily be copied to your guide.
   * [Achievement Block Templates](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/wiki/Achievement-Code-Blocks), loose achievement block templates if you prefer to create your own.
6. Save the page. Remember that you can also save it if it's not finished yet, but if you do, please put (WIP) before the title of the game to indicate so!
7. When the achievement guide is complete, please go to the directory of the game and add it to the table in alphabetical order. In the "Guide" column, use either "Full", "[m]", or anything else that describes your guide in one word.
