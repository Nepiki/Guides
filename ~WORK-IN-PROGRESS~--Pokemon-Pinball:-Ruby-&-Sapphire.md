# 1) Overview

\In this section, you can give a short synopsis about the game, your feelings about the set, as well as placing credits to the achievement set makers.

Outline game, release etc. Great integration of source material into pinball mechanics. Set size/score/dev/age. 4 gameplay modes (r/s & n/s). Ball speed doesn't affect the set so give both a try.
[Pokemon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire](https://retroachievements.org/game/789) is (unsurprisingly) a Pokemon-themed pinball game, specifically focusing on  Pokemon and locations featured in Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire, originally released in 2003.
## Controls
The default control scheme is counter-intuitive for many, so before you begin playing, check the options menu. 
list the 4 settings here
Pick whichever feels most natural to you - pinball is a game of timing and reactions so you don't want to be fumbling for the right button!
## The Boards
One board representing each game, with separate leaderboards (in-game and on-site), minor layout changes, unique mechanics, different pokemon spawns and separate bonus stages. Include annotated pics of the main boards and explain their features here. (see list below)
### Board features
* Ball upgrades - light up all 3 lights to upgrade your pokeball to great/ultra/master ball for increased score multipliers. Cycle through them with the flippers to hit them all. Ruby also has a ball upgrade pickup on the yellow loop.
* Ball savers - when lit up, Latios/Latias will catch your ball to keep it from falling into the pit and return it to Spoink
* Bumpers - hit these for points and to reveal your target in catch mode
* Catch - when GET is active with 2/3 triangles lit, enter Sharpedo/Wailmer's mouth to start
* Coin chute - send the ball up this path to earn 1/5/10 coins. Each trip lights up an arrow, allowing you to earn more
* Flippers - you! Main means of controlling the game
* GET/EVO - charge these by sending the ball up the respective path to activate catch and evolution modes
* Hatch - charge and activate hatch mode here
* Helpers
* - **Ruby**: hit the button by Chikorita to have it wake the Linoones. The left Linoone is the travel button and the right one toggles Makuhita from in/active. Pressing the right flipper will cause an active Makuhita to punch forwards. Time this carefully to send the ball up the coin chute or around the yellow loop. Hitting Nuzleaf twice will create a bridge so you can collect the ball upgrade.
* - **Sapphire**: Zigzagoon and stuff
* Pikachu/Pichu - when charged, these pokemon will prevent a ball that hits them from falling into the pit. Use the flippers to change Pikachu's side
* Pokeball - this spot is used in several game modes and the centre becomes a warp to access HOLE slots and bonus stages
* Pokemon counter - catching or hatching lights up one ball, evolution lights up two. When all three are lit, the next bonus stage activates
* Pokemon Mart/Centre - hit the door/the Plusle and Minun switches to open the mart and buy upgrades. When Evo is charged, door opens and becomes the Pokemon Centre
* Bonus multiplier - hit this button to increase the number. Score bonuses at the end of a ball will be totalled then multiplied by the value displayed
* Spoink - ball launcher
* Travel - charge this with 3 Gulpin/Seedot to activate travel
# 2) Game Modes
The main gameplay cycle, and best way to earn points, is to keep catching and evolving pokemon to progress through the different bonus boards, with later boards being worth more points. Every three balls lit up in the centre sends you to a bonus in this order: 1, 2, 1, 2, 3 (then repeat)
* Catch
* Hatch
* Evo
* Travel
* Bonus 1R (Kecleon)
* Bonus 1S (Duskull/Dusklops)
* Bonus 2R (Groudon)
* Bonus 2S (Kyogre)
* Bonus 3 (Rayquaza)
* Bonus 4 (Spheal/Sealeo)
