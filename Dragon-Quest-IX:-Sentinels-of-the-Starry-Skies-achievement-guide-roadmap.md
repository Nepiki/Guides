**Introduction**

Welcome to Dragon Quest IX: Sentinels of the Starry Skies (DQ9), RetroAchievement's 2021 set of the year! It is the ninth installment in the mainline Dragon Quest series and was released on Nintendo DS in 2009. For the first time in the series, DQ9 gives you complete control over the customization of your party.  You create the main character, any allies you would like to take along with you on the journey and have freedom to change jobs throughout the majority of the experience.

The game can be thought of as having two parts to it. The first is a very well done, but fairly standard JRPG plotline. After the main quest, the real work on the set begins in the post game content.

Blendedsea created an extraordinarily thorough DQ9 experience with this 164 achievement set. Mastering it will involve seeing nearly all of the entire game's expansive content. It is a very time consuming set to master, however there are reliable ways to manipulate the post game RNG so that you won't feel like you are at the mercy of randomness.
