# Walkthrough

Dummy Step 1

Here you can give a detailed explanation about every step, such as 
what the achievements are about, if there are any missables in this 
step, general tips to make sure every achievement is gotten in one run 
etc.

To make this header link to the section with these achievements, go 
to where the step is and hover over the header. A link icon should be 
visible on the left of the header, which you can right-click + copy and 
then paste where #step-1-dummy-step--total-points-999 currently is. 
Remove everything of the link before "step".

You can create as many steps as you desire. Recommended is to have 
one step dedicated to unmissable story achievements, while the others 
cover game-specific steps (like no-damage bosses, item collection etc.)

If the step has missables, be sure to make a bulletpoint list like below to inform the reader right away.
