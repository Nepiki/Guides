Hello there, I'm Nepiki! I'm a gamer who has an unofficial case of amnesia so I have an obsession with writing everything down so I don't forget about it! Joking aside, I do genuinely like writing, especially if it helps out other people. I don't have a lot of guides yet, but expect to see more pop up in the future!

For everything me related, here are some links you can check out:

# 2) Introduction

Wario Land II is the second game in the Wario Land series, or the third if you count the Virtual Boy release. This was also a launch title for the Gameboy Color, being one of the few games that came as a black cartridge, indicating that it could be played on both the Game Boy and Game Boy Color. For that reason, there are also two sets for this game. While I am talking exclusively about the Game Boy Color version today due to it having more achievements, this guide applies to the Game Boy version as well due to the similarity in achievements.

Wario gets some well-deserved rest after kicking out Captain Syrup in the first entry, but she was out for blood. She invaded Wario's castle with her troops and robs him of all the treasure he has. Wario, loving treasure more than his mother, isn't happy with this and immediately chases after her to get his well-earned treasure back.

This achievement set was created by [voiceofautumn](https://retroachievements.org/user/voiceofautumn), using the Game Boy achievements as a base and expanding upon it. Most of the achievements are earned naturally as you go for completion, but there are also some miscellaneous fun achievements to partake in for the full set.

# 3) Walkthrough

[**Step 1: Story Achievements (including alternate paths)**](#step-1-story-achievements-including-alternate-paths--total-points-80)

This covers the story of the game, as well as every alternate path to find. After beating the game for the first time, a stage select appears with an easy replay button, showing what stages lead to alternate exits. Don't worry too much about achievements for this part and just focus on having fun and beating the game, as nothing is missable.

[**Step 2: Power-up Achievements**](#step-2-power-up-achievements--total-points-14)

These will almost all come naturally as you're playing through the game, though some only appear at specific places and have to do with bosses. This part covers where the power-ups appear and what to do to trigger them.

[**Step 3: Hitless Boss Achievements**](#step-3-hitless-boss-achievements--total-points-tbd)

These achievements require you to do the bosses without taking a single hit. I recommend doing these on your first try (as ''losing'' does reset hit progress), or waiting with these until after you've completed the game, because you can instantly go to the boss by pressing down + a after selecting the stage.

[**Step 4: Miscellaneous Achievements**](#step-4-miscellaneous-achievements--total-points-tbd)

This part covers completion, coins, the infamous post-game time trial, and the post-game minigame.

_Defeat the Giant Snake_

Usually the first boss you come across (unless you took the alternate exit in 1-1 or 1-5), located in       
**Chapter 1:** One Noisy Morning        
**Story 5:** Defeat the giant snake      

Pretty straightforward boss, just keep jumping on his head and avoid getting bitten.

_Defeat Bobo_

Usually the second boss you come across, located in       
**Chapter 2:** SS Tea Cup      
**Story 5:** Defeat Bobo!!     

Yet again a pretty easy boss: wait in the right corner and jump on his head when he's low enough. Don't forget to duck when he uses the attack to lift you up, otherwise you'll lose.

_Defeat the Giant Bee_

Usually the third boss you come across, located in       
**Chapter 3:** Maze Woods      
**Story 5:** Defeat the giant bee!     

This one is slightly more difficult because of the stupid small bees coming out of the hives. Just keep running around and when they get lower, hit them from the side.

_Defeat Dunk in a Basketball duel_

Usually the fourth boss you come across, located in       
**Chapter 4:** In Town      
**Story 5:** Anyone for B-ball?     

One of my personal favourite boss battles in the game, you play basketball against a bunny with both you and your opponent being the ball. Jump on his head to turn him into a ball, and throw him up into the basket.

_Defeat Captain Syrup in Chapter 5_

Usually the fifth boss you come across, located in       
**Final Chapter:** Syrup Castle      
**Final Story:** The Final Battle!!     

This battle consists of two phases, with the first one just throwing the bombs back that Syrup throws at you. For the second phase, throw the bombs in the fire pillars when they are underneath her.

_Defeat the Mecha Goom_

This boss is part of an additional chapter. To access this, you have to go to the very first level and refuse to wake up. This can be done on a first playthrough, but it will take much longer before the game moves on. On an already cleared game, it will only take 5-10 seconds.

For this boss, you have to keep jumping over it until it slows down completely and is recharged by Syrup. During this recharging time, you can attack it from the front. Keep in mind that when it turns red, it will do a ground pound first that stuns Wario and will most likely cause your defeat if you don't jump beforehand. Hit it one final time and then throw it up to Syrup.

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/181562.png) [Cave Explorer (5)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/161475)   
_Defeat the Cave Master_

This boss is part of an additional chapter. To access this, you have to go to the 5th level of Chapter 1 (the fight against the Giant Snake). Use a ground pound where an arrow of coins is pointing downwards, then keep going up and to the right until you reach a door. From there, just keep going right through destructible walls until you reach a new door, bringing you to the alternate exit.

Lure this boss to the edge of the arena and then jump over him and dash him from behind. Do this three times and the boss battle is over.

_Defeat the Big Kamukamu_

This boss is part of an additional chapter. To access this, you have to go to the 4th level of Chapter 2 (Drop the Anchor). In the second room of the stage, go down all the way until you reach the bottom left, where a wall can be destroyed by throwing enemies at it. Continue from there until you reach the skull-faced block.

When you reach the fourth level of this chapter, be sure to take the top-right door once you reach the cross-shaped room. The bottom-right door will lead to an alternate exit.

You have to hit this boss three times from underneath. Be sure to swim up top so he comes towards you, after which you can hit him.

_Defeat Awabo_

This boss is part of an additional chapter. To access this, you have to go to the 4th level of Chapter 2 (Drop the Anchor). In the second room of the stage, go down all the way until you reach the bottom left, where a wall can be destroyed by throwing enemies at it. Continue from there until you reach the skull-faced block.

When you reach the fourth level of this chapter, be sure to take the bottom-right door once you reach the cross-shaped room. The top-right door will lead to a boss battle with Big Kamukamu.

Awabo will move diagonally through the screen, and you have to jump on his head three times. He'll spit out copies after every hit but they can't harm you, so ignore them.

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/181565.png) [Factory Shutdown (10)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/161479)   
_Defeat Captain Syrup in the Mysterious Factory_

This boss is part of an additional chapter. To access this, you have to go to the 4th level of Chapter 4 (Escape from the factory). In the second room of the stage, go down right away and start ground pounding the purple blocks. One of them should be breakable and will lead you to the secret exit.

This battle will consist of two phases. With the first one, you just have to dash at Syrup's capsule until the glass breaks, after which she will throw remote bombs at you. Jump on the bombs and throw them back at her.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/181566.png) [Spider-Bat-Ghost (10)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/161480)   
_Defeat the Ghost in the Uncanny Mansion_

This boss is part of an additional chapter. To access this, you have to go to the 5th level of Chapter 4 (Anyone for B-ball?). Right next to the boss door is a wall that can be destroyed by throwing an enemy at it, which will lead you to the exit.

For this battle, keep running around so the ghost can't grab you when he drops straight down. If he goes down diagonally, only charge at him when you are in a good position, otherwise just duck.
