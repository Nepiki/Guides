## 2) Introduction

Robin Hood for the Atari 2600 is a fairly simple game, It consists of 3 locations. The Sherwood forest, outside the castle and inside the castle. The general plot of the game is to either save Maid Marian or to steal Prince John’s gold. Essentially you move your way through each stage and at the end, you said Maid Marian or get the gold. The game then restarts at a higher difficulty and you do it all again.

_Beat the game on the hardest difficulty. (Start on 3 and beat the game twice)_

Just as the description says, you need to beat the game twice. You cannot start on the hardest difficulty so you must start as hard as you can, beat the game so the game makes it harder and then beat it again.

_Get though to the hardest difficulty starting on easy (Beat the game 3 times)._

Similar to the last one, you just need to start the game on the easiest setting and then keep beating it until you get the achievement, or 3 times like the description says.

_Beat the game without dying._

Harder than it sounds thanks to the 3rd stage. You do not get your bow in this level so you need to pray you do not get touched. Just keep trying, eventually you’ll get it though I recommend doing this on easy.

_Kill 50 enemies in the Sherwood Forest on hard (3) or hardest (After beating 3). (Must be done in the level before moving_

This one isn’t too challenging. The trick however is try not to miss as you only have a limited number of arrows. With that said however, you won’t have enough with a single life so you will need to kill yourself to replenish your stock. This achievement has to be done on Hard or greater unlike the previous one.

_Kill 50 enemies outside the castle on hard (3) or hardest difficulty (After beating 3). (Must be done in the level before movin._

Similar to the Forest achievements, this one must be done outside the castle. Use the same strategy as the forest ones and you will get the Outside Castle achievements.

_Get a total of 32,000 points in the sherwood forest without dying._

Also similar to the other two Forest achievements, however, this one is different in where you need to not miss a shot. It is recommended to do this on easy though if you manage to get it on your other playthroughs, it will save some time. Simply, just shoot the soldiers coming out and don’t get hit. If you do, you’ll need to restart.

_Get a score of 100,000._  

I recommend starting on the easiest level for this. Essentially kill as many enemies as you can while playing through the game. Your score will carry over with playthrough so get as much as you can on each stage and move on. Doing this will also unlock other achievements but try not to use up your lives unless you need to.
