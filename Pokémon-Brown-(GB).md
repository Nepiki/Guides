Just catch **Snorlax** in Route 61 and **Kangaskhan** in Haunted Forest without failing, just save game before battle started. Don't let them escape/flee or defeat them otherwise you need to start new game.

Just catch 4 of 8 legendary Pokémon, just save game before battle started. Don't let them escape/flee or defeat them otherwise you need to start new game.

Just evolve **Nidorina** (female) into **Nidoqueen** with using Moon Stone and trade for **Nidoking** in Moraga Town House. Don't use Moon Stone for other 3 Pokemon like **Clefairy**, **Jigglypuffy** or **Nidorino** (male) otherwise you can't trade for **Nidoking** because this hack has only **ONE** Moon Stone. So, be careful.

Just don't defeat Patrol Pallet with 2 or more Pokémon in your party. It works only **ONE** Pokémon in your party.
