# 0) Author Information

Hello there, I'm Nepiki! I'm a gamer who has an unofficial case of amnesia so I have an obsession with writing everything down so I don't forget about it! Joking aside, I do genuinely like writing, especially if it helps out other people. I don't have a lot of guides yet, but expect to see more pop up in the future!

For everything me related, here are some links you can check out:

# 3) Walkthrough

[**Step 1: 5 stars Achievements**](#step-1-5-stars-achievements--total-points-218)

This basically comes down to a level-by-level walkthrough. Every level has at least 5 or more stars, that count as your hitpoints. Whenever you get hit, you lose 1 star and have to regain it before the end of the level. There are passwords for every level, so you can easily return to that level for these or other achievements.

[**Step 2: Game Clear Achievements**](#step-2-game-clear-achievements--total-points-240)

There are several achievements dedicated to beating the game in one setting. You can get them all at once on Hard mode, but you can also decide to do them on Normal mode first. The difference between Normal and Hard is that ----. A single playthrough lasts slightly longer than half an hour.

[**Step 3: Miscellaneous Achievements**](#step-3-miscellaneous-achievements--total-points-208)

Miscellaneous achievements that usually ask you to play the game in a slightly different way than you've been doing (no usage of the wand etc.)
