Hello there, I'm Nepiki! I'm a gamer who has an unofficial case of amnesia so I have an obsession with writing everything down so I don't forget about it! Joking aside, I do genuinely like writing, especially if it helps out other people. I don't have a lot of guides yet, but expect to see more pop up in the future!

For everything me related, here are some links you can check out:

[**Step 2: Hitless Boss Achievements**](#step-2-hitless-boss-achievements--total-points-14)

ALL OF THESE ACHIEVEMENT ARE MISSABLE.

Every boss of a dungeon has a hitless achievement attached to them. This step will cover tactics for every single boss. Note that mini-bosses and other hitless objectives are covered in the next step for consistency sake and to ensure you will truly only have to do one playthrough.

[**Step 3: Missable Achievements**](#step-3-missable-achievements--total-points-60)

ALL OF THESE ACHIEVEMENTS ARE MISSABLE.

This is an almost complete step-by-step walkthrough for the game, sorted chronologically and split up in "chapters". This covers a lot of achievements and is made to ensure that you will only have to do one playthrough without missing anything. Please also refer to section 4 for important notes, as you have to make progress on some missable achievements throughout the entire game.

## Step 3: Missable Achievements | **Total points: 60**

### Achievements with missables throughout the entire game (read before continuing)

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/90713.png) [A Dream Come True [m] (50)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/28828)   
_Help Marin fulfill her dream_

-=MISSABLE=-

This achievement is earned after beating the final boss and watching the ending. The goal is pretty simple: don't die. Ever. This achievement can only be obtained while the file select screen shows 000 under your name. While this might sound difficult, it's very doable in my opinion. Save often by pressing start, select, A and B all at the same time, and whenever you die, just reset the game. I recommend saving at the start of every dungeon anyway for the hitless boss achievements.

Additionally, I recommend going for the Color Dungeon A.S.A.P., which is available after the second dungeon. Go for the Blue Tunic to reduce damage taken, which is far more important than increasing damage dealt. You can hold one of Tracy's potions at a time (bought from the store south of the cave where Bow-Wow was held captive) that revive you and refill all your hearts on losing all your hearts. Finally, I recommend getting the Boomerang after the sixth dungeon because it is a very overpowered weapon in this game that kills most enemies in one hit.

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/90733.png) [The Travels of THIEF [m] (25)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/31930)   
_Complete the Photo Album_

-=MISSABLE=-

You need to get a total of 12 pictures to complete the photo album. After clearing the first dungeon, immediately talk to the camera mouse in his house east of the cave where Bow-Wow is held captive so that he will always appear when needed. Be sure to save before talking to the mouse, as there is an achievement for accepting his offer to photograph you, and rejecting him. Reload the save file after getting either.

Four of these are completely missable, which are:

1) Between Dungeon 2 and Dungeon 3, after talking to Richard who sends you to his castle, go stand in front of the bridge of the castle.
2) Between Dungeon 3 and Dungeon 4, Marin will be accompanying you. See achievement "Date Night - A Walk on the Beach [m]" for the requirements.
3) Between Dungeon 3 and Dungeon 4, Marin will be accompanying you. See achievement "Date Night - All is Not Well [m]" for the requirements.
4) Between Dungeon 3 and Dungeon 4, Marin will be accompanying you. See achievement "Date Night - An Afternoon at the Windmill [m]" for the requirements.

The remainder of the pictures can be done at any time.

5) Obtained after talking to the camera man.
6) Peek over the window of Old Man Ulrira's House, south of Marin and Tarin's house in Mabe Village.
7) Aproach Bow-Wow in Mabe Village.
8) After the fishermen under the bridge has fished up something, return to him later and talk to him while the photographer is swimming there. Requires the Flippers.
9) After obtaining the magnifying lens from the "Magnifying Lens" achievement, go to the north-east house in the animal village. 
10) Approach the grave where you take the ghost to who follows you during the "A Ghostly Escort" achievement.
11) Cross a bridge in Tal Tal Heights and the photographer will appear. I'm not sure if every bridge works, but I got it on the far east bridge next to the rooster house.
12) Steal something from the shop by walking around the shopkeeper and while he looks to the wall, exit the shop. The photographer doesn't appear during this action. ONLY STEAL SOMETHING AFTER YOU BOUGHT AT LEAST THE SHOVEL, BOMBS, AND BOW OR YOU'LL RUIN THE PLAYTHROUGH!!!

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/90732.png) [Shell Collection [m] (25)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/28849)   
_Collect all possible 26 Secret Seashells across Koholint_

-=MISSABLE=-

This achievement can be very nasty so proceed with extra caution. Do NOT get the L-2 Sword after obtaining 20, because it will make the remaining seashells disappear from your save file. Wait until you got all 26.

Pay extra attention to the following 3 completely missable seashells:

1) Go to the Seashell Mansion immediately when getting 5 seashells to get a sixth. This won't work if you have more than 5 seashells.
2) Go to the Seashell Mansion immediately when getting 10 seashells to get an elevent. This won't work if you have more than 10 seashells.
3) After reviving the flying rooster, go to the cave south of Richard's Castle with the cave behind 5 bottomless pits. You can only (legitimately) cross these pits with the rooster. The rooster will disappear after clearing dungeon 7 and cannot be regained.

For the remainder of the seashells, please refer to [This Zeldadungeon Guide](https://www.zeldadungeon.net/wiki/Link%27s_Awakening_Secret_Seashells_(Game_Boy)).

### Buying achievements (do these before you can steal)

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/223970.png) [Buying Bombs [m] (1)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/201702)   
_Purchase bombs (Can't steal them or already be labeled a THIEF)_

Available in the shop after clearing the first dungeon, and costs only 10 rupees.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/223969.png) [Buying the Shovel [m] (5)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/201701)   
_Purchase a shovel (Can't steal them or already be labeled a THIEF)_

Available in the shop right from the start, and costs 200 rupees.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/224006.png) [Buying the Bow [m] (1)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/201738)   
_Purchase the Bow (Can't steal them or already be labeled a THIEF)_

Available in the shop after buying the shovel, and costs 980 rupees. This is a huge amount, but I do recommend getting it as fast as possible because it will make a lot of achievements easier. Absolutely get this before the fifth dungeon because you need it there for achievements.
