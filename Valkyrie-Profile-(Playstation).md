## The guide /!\ WIP /!\

Written by [Sines](https://retroachievements.org/user/Sines), don't hesitate to ping me if you see mistakes in this guide. 

This guide is an extended and more explicit version of what was initially my routing notes. Everything has been personally tested by me and should be replicable by following the notes. **This is not a play-by-play walkthrough**, the goal is to cover all the achievements, provide a roadmap to obtain them and give tips & tricks to save on time. 

# 1) Synopsis

|   |   |
|:--|:--|
|Set Difficulty| 4/10, Not a very hard game but can be time-consuming|
|Approximate time to master| 40~60h depending on efficiency and use of emulator speed-up|
|Minimum numbers of playthroughs needed| 2, technically 1.5 with some key backup saves|
|Number of missable achievements| 15 as per set tag, I'd argue for more but I'll detail more when I cover them|
|Does difficulty affect achievements?|Yes, Normal & Hard mode have mutually exclusive dungeons|
|Hardest achievement of the set| [**Voices**](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108551) for the grind, [**Pest Control**](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/109422) is technically the hardest fight in the game|

# 2) Introduction

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://lparchive.org/Valkyrie-Profile-(by-ApplesandOranges)/Update%2057/1-IdxTp4b.png" />
</p>

Valkyrie Profile is an RPG loosely inspired by Nordic mythology where you play as a Valkyrie tasked to retrieve the souls of dead warriors in preparation for the Ragnarok. Due to the premise, this mean that every single one of your companion in the game will die before joining you, often in terrible ways, and you will be here to watch it happen. Fun times !

The gameplay loop is a mix of exploration, with a bit of platforming, and classic RPG turn based battle with a twist. While fighting, each of your 4 team member is assigned to a right-side button X O □ ∆ and will attack when you press their symbol. It's up to you to mix & match your lineup and pay attention to their move and timing to be able to juggle and combos enemy, filling a special gauge that will then let you unleash devastating Super unique to each character. There are of course a few more systems but I'll cover them in due time. 

# 3) Walkthrough

While technically you don't need to do two full playthrough if you are already familiar enough with the game, I'd recommend to do the set in 2 playthroughs. The first one in Normal mode for the Ending B and the second one in Hard mode for the Ending A. You totally can switch which ending for which difficulty you want to tackle and a lot of the regular Normal mode dungeons are also available in Hard mode but I'll present the achievements with that order in mind.

Also as the majority of characters recruitment are trivial but can slightly change in unlock order, I'll cover them in the Misc section.

[**Step 1: Ending B Normal Mode**](#step-1-ending-b-normal-mode)

First playthrough, you don't have access to the harder puzzle of Hard mode dungeons but you also don't get the most powerful equipment. I'd actually recommend a Normal mode run for anyone not familiar with the game rather than easy as the difficulty works a bit backward in the game. You don't have to level all your characters from level 1 as in hard mode so don't hesitate to test different lineups and see what clicks for you. This run should cover most of the progression and misc achievements. There are a couple of missables, but nothing that wouldn't be obvious if you take time to read the achievement description.
***

[**Step 2: Ending A Hard Mode**](#step-2-ending-a-hard-mode)

Now that you are familiar with the game, this should be a breeze to go through for the most part. While everyone recruited start at level 1, you have access to enough tools to make it a blessing in disguise for customization. Hard mode dungeons are not necessarily harder from the enemies and boss encounters but more due to their puzzles and gimmick. I wont provide a full solution of those outside of a bit of advice here and there based on my experience. If not already the case, this run should also cover any story mode Misc achievements that you did not get through the Ending B playthrough. It's also here that you should prepare the most for postgame as this is the save you will need to use to access it if you want to unlock everything. 

***

[**Step 3: Postgame and Misc**](#step-3-dummy-step-3--total-points-999)

This last step will cover the postgame, unlocked by having a save in the last dungeon of the respective ending. Called the Seraphic Gate, you will have to run through it once for the usual map/treasure/boss completion achievements, find a couple of bonus fight and this is also where you will have to engage the biggest grind of the game to unlock 100% Voice clip completion. I'll also use this part to cover the non-story specific achievements that can (and in majority will) get unlocked long before you finish the game.

# 4) General Tips
### Exploration
Learn on how to use crystals. They are mandatory for most of the map completion achievements and for some of the chests acquisition. There are mainly five ways to use them.
 
* The first way is simply to create platform on walls or on the ground. This is used for straightforward platforming and scaling some wall. You can only have three at the same time, if you create a fourth the oldest will de-spawn
* Second way is to slash them to create pieces. Those pieces are independent from the crystal spawn count and can be used to reach the maximum height in a lot of rooms: create a large crystal where you want to climb, create and slash 3 small crystal to create pieces and move those pieces onto the big crystal. You can then jump once on the crystal, pick up the pieces again and this time stack them up (also work with chests if there are any lying around).
* Breaking a crystal while being near it will boost you to the side. This is only really needed in a handful of dungeon where low ceiling keep you from doing a straight jump.
* Breaking a crystal will also spawn a semi-invisible platform that you can jump on. This platform will slowly descend towards the ground before de-spawning, you should get the rhythm after a couple of tries. There are a few places where you cant simply scale up a wall due to terrain and will need to create a crystal on a ceiling to make a platform and continue.
* Finally you can throw crystal at enemies to freeze them for a bit. This can be used to bypass encounters but is at not point required for the set mastery.

As a misc, crystal are also used in a couple of puzzle. I'll touch upon it when covering the related section, but generally speaking crystals can reflect ice beam and broken pieces can be used as a weight.

Other than that, a good 3rd party map helps tremendously for chest and map completion. I couldn't find any online be it wiki or gamefaq, but if you manage to find a copy the Prima Official Strategy Guide is great !
***

### Levelling Up

As briefly touched upon before, Valkyrie Profile difficulty is a bit wonky once you know how the game work. As far as I'm aware there are no change in enemies stats, it only change which dungeon you have access to, how many xp you get and what level your fresh recruit start at (also lock you out of ending A if you chose Easy, but there are no reason to do an Easy run in the first place). In Hard mode, everyone start at level 1 and this can greatly get abused !

* A couple of equipment allow you to boost characters on each level up. The main two are the Bracelet of Zoe that boost DME (HP basically) by 300 per level up and the Emerald Necklace that boost CP (used for skills unlock) by 100 on the same condition.
* You can quickly level up new recruits through the "Party" menu. There you have the ability to attribute the "Event Exp" that you got while playing. I'd recommend not giving too much exp at once in order to not hit the CP cap (999) and also because being slightly under-levelled is not that bad if you have good equipment. For mage or archer, if you put them in the back row you could even skip this step entirely as they are mostly safe and should catch up quickly to the level of the dungeon you are running.
* An alternative use for the exp distribution would be to keep it for the units you don't like and plan to send to transfer.
* There should be not point at all in the story where you need to grind levels, but if you really want to there are very few places where you can farm for free. Any enemy killed will be gone for good until you quit the dungeon, which cost 2 time period. The few exception I found where the Arkdain Ruins that should re-spawn enemies when you goes through the entry gate (last zone before going back to the world map) and any chest that is trapped by an enemy spawn. You can kill the enemy, change room without picking the chest content and it will spawn a new one from it's trap. Again, this is not needed.
***

### Fighting Tips

* You can run away from most non-boss fight, even Zombie Dragon. Running away from a battle make the enemy despawn entirely, as if you had killed it.
* Having one or two mages in your lineup can trivialize most fights: by hitting Select and choosing the Magic tab, you can cast "All Units" spell. Those spells will hit every enemies with the same potency as if you had cast it regularly on a single enemy. The only downside is that you cant combo from it.
* The combo gauge increase your damages by the hit percentage so a useful strategy is to have characters with low damages but lots of hits go first and have your hard hitter attack last.
* Related to the previous tip, AOE spells when cast as a Big Magic also benefit from this and can be used to cheese a lot of early bosses. You wont get any unbreakable rod for a while, but you get a lot of breakable one that you could keep in reserve for a difficult boss
* Once you have the Guts and Auto-Item skills you become basically invulnerable. Guts make it so you have a high chance of surviving a killing blow with 1HP and Auto-Item can be configured to automatically use the revive items when guts fail. Outside of self-imposed challenge, there is no reason to use any other combo of main skills on any character.
* The Heal spell is a percentage-based AOE, meaning it will heal your team the same amount if cast by a lv 1 or by a lv 50.
* In the Ability tab you can switch around the attack order of your character. This can be useful to get better synergy. An example is switching around the attacks of Aelia so that she throws her spear in her first attack, making her timings easier to use.
* Slayer weapons are great for quickly getting rid of powerful enemies. The one you should use the most is the Dragon Slayer, with maybe the Beast Slayer being useful. They have a low chance of breaking but you shouldn't play around RNG, I'd recommend only using them on the relevant stationary enemy before going back to your regular loadout.
 

## Step 1: Ending B Normal Mode 

For this route, no seemingly random requirement to worry about: enjoy the dungeons, familiarize yourself with the game, send one or two Einherjar per chapter to please Freya and it should be a straight line to Jotunheim.

### Artolian Mountain Ruins
Baby's first dungeon and the tutorial, you should have no trouble here. One item you can find here is the Treasure Search accessories which will make a small blue light appears around Lenneth when she is in a room with unopened treasures. Quite useful if you're playing blind.

***

### Forest of Woe

Still the early game, if you use the Treasure Search accessories it can be a bit hard to see it trigger due to the snow effect. It's also where the game start the trend of hiding chests behind the foreground so don't forget to check those areas. I wont repeat it later because it will always work the same but this is also likely the first instance where you need to stack broken pieces/empty chests on top of a big crystal to be able to reach enough height to fully map the boss room.

### Solde Catacombs

Some light puzzle elements start to creep up. Your goal is to put all of the statue onto a seal. You can push/pull by pressing X near a statue, and you can slash the stone demons with your sword. You can trivialize the boss by equipping Valkyrie with a bow and bursting him down on the first round. There is a hidden room at the start of the dungeon accessible by jumping down the well.

### Dragoncastle Caverns
Pretty straightforward dungeon. The boss can be oneshot with a Dragon Slayer and you can get one for free for visiting Angrim's House.

### Nethov Swamp
Same as the previous dungeon, the Dragon Slayer can be used to rekt the boss.

***
### Gorhla Cult Headquarters
Another straightforward dungeon with the exception of the boss room. There you will need to stack chests / broken crystals on top of a big crystal and also create a hidden platform to reach the top part of the map and the additional treasures.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/153476.png) [Vampire Hunter Valkyrie [m] (3)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108421)   
_In Gorhla Cult Headquarters defeat Thaumaturgist and two Lesser Vampires with only Valkyrie in party_
* There are a couple of enemies with that layout in the dungeon, one being right in the entrance room. Just dismiss everyone in your party for the fight, it shouldnt be hard to beat. If the Thaumaturgist is giving you trouble you can equip Valkyrie with a bow to kill him first.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/153477.png) [Boss VII (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108422)   
_Defeat Noble Vampire and Will-O'-Wisps in Gorhla Cult Headquarters_
* Will-O'-Wisps are annoying because they will explode on your whole party if their HP fall below half. Pay attention to your damage and dont hesitate to end your turn early if you cant kill them before they reach their threshold. The fight can be made very easy if you equip Valkyrie with the Lightning Edge sword: it absorb Electricity attacks which is the majority of the damages you face here. You can get one through RNG drop in the first Sacred Phase reward or is buyable in the Divine Item shop.

***
### Oddrock Caves
The dungeons gimmick is to reflect the ice beam toward pillars to make them breakable. You can do so by creating a crystal where the beam should hit on the ground / ceiling. The exact location can be finnicky sometimes so be prepared for a bit of trial and errors. If you get frozen by the ice beam or by touching a moving statue dont worry it will worn off on it's own, it's only there to annoy you and waste your time. Their are multiple dragon zombies but they are still vulnerable to the Dragon Slayer. Alternatively if you dont care about their exp, you could just flee the fights to move past them. The boss is weak to the Daemon Slayer sword which you should have gotten from a chest in Nethov Swamps. Dont forget to bring Kashell to the boss fight for the [m] achievement.

***
### Brahms Castle
The whole dungeon is timed which is annoying for the map completion. Most of the big room will require you to stack broken crystals to be able to reach enough height for the top part. You will need at least two trips to map everything in any case as you will be thrown out of the dungeons after killing the boss, leaving some of his room unfinished. As we are doing a B ending run with this step, it doesn't matter when you meet Brahms at all.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/153484.png) [Brahms (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108429)

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/153485.png) [Boss IX [m] (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108430)   
_Defeat Brahms in his Castle_
* Brahms fight is actually not that bad. While he has very high damages, he can only kill one person per turn. With that in mind, having a mage on resurrections duty or manually using items should be enough while your other two members deal damage. If it's to tough for you in this chapter, you can always do this fight later on once you have Guts and Auto-Items.

***
### Tower of Lezard Valeth
Your first big boy dungeon ! You will start the dungeon right after Lorenta recruitment so be sure to be ready. The layout is very annoying but there is no confusing gimmick to it. Locate and activate two machines to be able to use the teleportation circles on the floor. One will lead you to additional treasures, the other to the boss room. If you teleport and see a save point that mean you are about to face the boss ! The boss is [m] if you dont do it in a single go: going out of the tower will make him escape instead of fighting you. For map completion you will need to do the dungeon twice (including re-activating the machines) because of the boss room not being fully mapped before the fight. If you use Lorenta for the whole dungeon she will be largely on par with the rest of your team, don't forget that you need her in your team for the other [m] achievement.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/153495.png) [Boss XI [m] (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108440)   
_Defeat Lezard Valeth and Dragon-Tooth Warriors in Tower of Lezard Valeth_
* Dragon-Tooth Warriors are vulnerable to the Dragon Slayer but you shouldn't need it. One annoying skill they have is that when you kill them they will boost the stats of the other enemies. If you don't want to deal with this trouble, equip Valkyrie with a bow and have an archer and/or a mage in your party to focus Lezard first.

_Collect all treasure in Tower of Lezard Valeth_
* One item of note in this dungeon is the Creation Gem: this accessory equitable by Lenneth give you more item transmutation choices and is critical to latter on access the most broken crafting options.

***
### Black Dream Tower
This dungeon works like a Tower of Lezard Valeth:Easy mode. There are tons of passageways but less than in the previous dungeon and even the boss has a similar layout to Lezard. There's a bit of crystal platforming needed but nothing difficult. You should get all of them for the achievement anyway but pay extra attention to the Fairy Bottle artifact you get: with the Creation Gem equipped you can transmute it to Orihalcon, and then transmute this to the Creation Jewel accessory which give you access to a lot of broken crafting options.

***
### Cave of Thackus
This dungeon is thankfully straightforward but is likely your first encounter with water physics. If Valkyrie barely touch a pixel of water your jump height will get significantly nerfed. To progress you will have to cut underwater flowers stem and jump on them while they rise to the surface. Make sure to talk to the sorcerer's ghost twice when you start the dungeon to get the seal and once more on your way to the exit to get the achievement and some bonus party exp.

***
### Arkdain Ruins
The layout here is again easy to follow. Annoyingly most of the chest are trapped with an enemy spawn. You will need to create a hidden platform by breaking a crystal on a ceiling to progress to the boss room. Once defeated, create your own crystals on the woman encased in crystal to go around and find additional chests. You don't have to worry about her for now, you will get add her to your party later in Hard mode.

### Lost City of Dipan
Big story dungeon ! The start is rough, you will need to kill Barbarossa twice back-to-back. Once this is done, he will respawn again go whack him once more for the "Still not Dead [m]" achievement. If you are strong enough you might want to let him hit you for a while to get some of the boss related voice completion file but it's not that important. Once you get sent to the past, you will need to talk to an NPC in order to learn about the Queen secret passage (even if you already know where it is). The passage is behind the bookshelves on the top floor of the castle. Once you are sent back to the present, to reach the boss you will need to break the stained glass mural in the room with a save point. You will need to use crystal platforming to reach it. The boss fight is a bit annoying, make sure to kill Gyne first as he can ressurect his fellow mages.

### Forest of Spirits
This forest is quite large but fairly easy to navigate. You will need to defeat multiple boss to complete the fetch quest and making the elves repair the Flame Gem for Odin. This is another dungeon that you will need to run a minimum of two times for completion: after you repair the Flame Gem and exit > re-enter you will gain access to a mist covered area that will lead you to a second Cockatrice and additional treasures. Some of the chests are fairly well hidden behind tree branches so make sure to check every pixel if you see the Treasure Search blue glow on you.

### Palace of the Dragon
This is the only dungeon in Normal mode that play like a Hard mode dungeons, so if you never played those before I hope you enjoy puzzles ! The short version is that to progress you need to discover Stones (check behind paintings) and then use those on statue to move forward to the next segment. While this is not a full walkthrough, here are some things to know:
* When you find a first room with multiple statues, take note on what direction they are facing. You will soon encounter a similar room with a close door, interact with the statue to rotate them in the same position as before to move forward
* In the long corridor with multiple doors you need to enter them in a specific order to unlock the way forward. The order, with the leftmost door being 1, is 3 7 5 4 2 1 6 8
* Near the end you will have to move through two rooms with a patrolling statue. You will need to get "caught" at least once on purpose for map completion. After that to move through the first one you will need to walk behind the statue until it open a hidden door for you. For the second room you will need to dodge the statue a couple of times until it "tires" out and go in the corner. Interact with it to get a new Stone for progression
* The boss is a joke due to his low defense. Don't forget to bring Aelia for the [m] achievement. What is not a joke however is the crystal platforming that you will need to perform to get every chests and finish the map completion. It will require you to spawn a big crystal on the ground and create a hidden platform from the ceiling. With the right timing and placement, you can jump on in and have enough height to reach the top part of the boss room.

### Jotunheim Palace
Last stop before the end of the world ! The dungeon is quite vast and has tons of enemies, I'd recommend equipping the Dimension Slip accessory (transmuted from the Dryad's Bark artifact) to skip them and concentrate on exploring. You get access back to everyone you previously had sent, so you now can assemble your dream team ! You have multiple rooms where you will be required to walk on disappearing platform, the timing can be a tad strict but if you fail they reappear on their own after a while. For map completion, make sure that you fully map the "bridges" section (narrow rooms with a Up and Down movement option and a bridge in a background). It can be tricky to notice on the map screen, but you need to scale up the room with crystal to fully complete them. As can be expected the bosses Bloodbane and Surt can be tough, I once again recommend equipping Guts and Auto-Item on everyone. They know the Heal spell so you will need to deal enough damage or they will get back to full HP. If you haven't played with it yet, having a mage or two with the spells Sap Guard and Might Reinforce could be the push you need if you're a bit short. Bloodbane has some unique lines that cant be gotten in the postgame so you might want to try and trigger them for the voice completion file. After defeating him you will get the most powerful sword of the story mode for Lenneth ! Surt also have unique voicelines but because you cant save after you beat him they wont get added to the voice completion so you dont have to worry about it. Once beaten, you get a half-assed ending with some cryptic dialogues. Congratulation, you've beaten the tutorial ! Time to move on to the "true" ending on hard mode.
