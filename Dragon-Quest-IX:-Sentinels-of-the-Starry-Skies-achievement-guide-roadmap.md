**Introduction**

Welcome to Dragon Quest IX: Sentinels of the Starry Skies (DQ9), RetroAchievement's 2021 set of the year! It is the ninth installment in the mainline Dragon Quest series and was released on Nintendo DS in 2009. For the first time in the series, DQ9 gives you complete control over the customization of your party.  You create the main character, any allies you would like to take along with you on the journey and have freedom to change jobs throughout the majority of the experience.

The game can be thought of as having two parts to it. The first is a very well done, but fairly standard JRPG plotline. After the main quest, the real work on the set begins in the post game content. Blendedsea created an extraordinarily thorough DQ9 experience with this 164 achievement set. Mastering it will involve seeing nearly all of the entire game's expansive content. It is a very time consuming set to master, however there are reliable ways to manipulate the post game RNG so that you won't feel like you are at the mercy of randomness.

There are essentially five main components to mastering the set: **the main story and missable boss achievements, completing the full bestiary, mastering all weapons and job classes, completing all side quests, obtaining all items and alchemies**. This guide will break the set down into four primary corresponding sections.


**Resources**


You will need to begin the game with a save file that has had the DLC activated. **Blendedsea has provided a starting save file for this purpose in [the second post of the game's official forum topic.](https://retroachievements.org/viewtopic.php?t=11708)** Additionally, it would not be reasonable to include every single thing needed to master the set in this guide, so instead I will reference other stand alone guides that are complete and fully sufficient for mastering the set.  All of these resources will be thorough explained in this guide when referenced.
