## About the Author

Hi! I'm Wes. Thanks for your interest in the Crazy Kong set. Many years ago [I developed an interest in the arcade Donkey Kong series](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/05/is-this-the-worlds-first-perfect-game-of-donkey-kong/). I'm hoping this set could help spark an interest with you, and I'm hoping I can help you unlock the secrets to mastering it.

## Introduction

Crazy Kong is a 1981 arcade game developed and published by Falcon. It's a clone and "official" bootleg of the classic arcade game [Donkey Kong](https://retroachievements.org/game/11943), with some slight modifications made to the gameplay to accommodate Crazy Kong's much weaker hardware.

The objective is the same as the original Donkey Kong. You, Jumpman, must navigate four different platforming levels while avoiding obstacles and enemies to save the girl, Pauline.

There are four different types of stages: barrel boards, conveyors (also known as pie factories), spring boards, and rivet boards.

The game starts at L=01 **and ends at L=22.** Each level consists of four stages: barrel, conveyor, spring, and rivet, in that order. Stage 22-1 is the 85th stage of the game.

Due to hardware limitations, only four barrels can be on-screen at any time. On the barrel stage, there can only be a single fireball active at once. On the conveyor stage, only two fireballs can ever be active at once. This is a stark contrast to Donkey Kong, which many more obstacles and enemies your way.

These limitations mean **Crazy Kong is significantly easier than Donkey Kong.** I am convinced that with enough practice, anyone can reach L=22 and finish the game.

## Gameplay Mechanics You Must Understand

There are several quirks of Crazy Kong's (and by extension, Donkey Kong's) programming you can take advantage of to turn the tables in your favor.

### You Control the Barrels

That's right. You control all of the barrels on the screen. "Barrel control" steadily increases until you hit L=05, at which point you have "maximum control".

How exactly does barrel control work? **Barrels respond to your current joystick direction.** If you are pointing the joystick towards a ladder and a barrel is rolling over that ladder, there is an increased likelihood the barrel will go down that ladder. This control starts at roughly 25% on L=01, and increases to 75% by the time you have reached L=05.

Knowing this, you can manipulate all the barrels on the screen to do your bidding. Take a look at the video below:

### Barrels Can Be Dodged With 100% Precision

This is an exploit that exists in Crazy Kong, but not Donkey Kong. It is called the "ladder trick". Take a look at the video below:

<<< TODO, insert a video here >>>

That's right, when barrels are rolling over you and you're near the top of a ladder, they will never roll down the ladder and kill you. This was in the earliest versions of Donkey Kong (which Crazy Kong's code is based on), but was later patched by the game's developers because they found it made Donkey Kong too easy! Fortunately, the exploit still exists in Crazy Kong.

### There is Only ONE Correct Way to Play the Rivets

The rivet board will be the most dangerous board in Crazy Kong. It is _essential_ that you learn to play it correctly if you want to make it to L=22. The proper way to play the rivet board is by using something called the "Star Pattern".

With the Star Pattern, you clear most of the left-hand rivets, grab the left hammer, and run across while clearing the final left-hand rivet.

**Read that carefully a few times and be sure you understand it.** Here's a video demonstration:

<<< TODO, show a video here >>>

On the rivet stage, when you smash fireballs with the hammer, **they will respawn on the opposite side of the screen that you're standing on.** In other words, you can force them to respawn on the left-hand side of the screen (where they can no longer hurt you). Nice!

### The Fireballs are Random, but Follow Predictable Rules

These are the rules you need to memorize:
* Fireballs will _only_ go down ladders if you are below the fireball in terms of your current screen position.
* Fireballs will _only_ go up or down a ladder if they approach the ladder from the left-hand side.
* When a fireball freezes in place, it will always unfreeze by moving left. It will never unfreeze by moving right.
* Only two fireballs are capable of freezing.
* Fireballs are not aware of your presence, they float around mindlessly.
* On a rivet stage, fireballs will respawn on the opposite side of the screen that you're currently standing on. If you're on the right-hand side, they'll respawn on the left-hand side, and vice versa.

## Walkthrough

### Progression Achievements

| <img src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/325543.png"> | How High Can You Try | Clear 1-1 | 5 Points |
|---|---|---|---|

This is very simple: clear your first barrel board. The only caveat to this barrel board is you have extremely limited barrel control.

One tip to keep in mind: the bottom hammer can oftentimes be a trap! The safest way to play barrel boards is to skip it and only grab the top hammer. You can use the top hammer like a shield. Take a look at this video:

| <img src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/325545.png"> | Only 20 More Loops Left | Clear 1-4 | 5 Points |
|---|---|---|---|

For any new player, getting this achievement is a great accomplishment. You will have successfully cleared all four board types! Here are videos for how to clear 1-2, 1-3, and 1-4. Take special note of the Star Pattern being used to clear 1-4. Remember, **it is the only correct way to play the board.**

By reaching this achievement, you will also have earned your bonus man at 7000 points. You only have four lives to finish a game of Crazy Kong! In other words, each life should last you 6 levels (around 21 boards).

| <img src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/325546.png"> | Novice of the Arcade | Clear 2-4 | 5 Points |
|---|---|---|---|
| <img src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/325547.png"> | Student of the Arcade | Clear 3-4 | 10 Points |
| <img src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/325548.png"> | Enthusiast of the Arcade | Clear 4-4 | 10 Points |
| <img src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/325549.png"> | Veteran of the Arcade | Clear 5-4 | 10 Points |

These achievements should all play out fairly similarly. Some things to note as you progress through this:

* The speed of fireballs and springs will increase with each level.
* Your barrel control will increase with each level. Always be thinking about it on barrel boards.
* After clearing L=04, you will have reached "max difficulty". The game gets no harder than this!

If you are serious about your learning, I recommend immediately moving on to working on the next achievement...

| <img src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/325550.png"> | Veteran of the Arcade | Clear 4-4 on your very first life | 25 Points |
|---|---|---|---|

Donkey Kong circles refer to this as "getting a start". On your first life, you've reached maximum difficulty. Because you have the most barrel control at maximum difficulty, generally L=05+ is considered easier (less random) than levels 1 through 4. It is common practice for Donkey Kong players to reset their game if they do not reach 5-1 on their first life.

| <img src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/325551.png"> | Prodigy of the Arcade | Score 200,000 points | 25 Points |
|---|---|---|---|
| <img src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/325552.png"> | Master of the Arcade | Score 400,000 points | 25 Points |

After you're used to getting a start, you should earn these naturally with a little bit of practice. As a measuring stick, you'll likely score 400,000 points somewhere around L=17.
