# Introduction

Pokémon TCG2 was released on March 28, 2001, exclusively in Japan, and was the last Pokémon game released for the Game Boy Color. Approximately two months before the game was released in Japan, IGN called it by the English title "Pokémon Trading Card Game 2: Return of Team Rocket" and declared that an English release of the game was likely. However, this obviously never happened. Despite its growing popularity, it hasn't been officially localized outside of Japan and probably never will.

In 2010, Artemis251 began working on an English translation patch, despite not knowing know how to read or speak Japanese. They state on their [website](http://artemis251.fobby.net/pkmntcg2/index.html), "I figured that, since all attempts to translate the game have gone dead, I'd take a stab at it myself. Now, I'll admit that I really don't know Japanese, but I've done a 'best-effort' with the best online translators and context clue ad-libbing
that I could." The translation wouldn't be finished and available for download until June 14th, 2012.

The game adds many new features not present in the original, such as new cards, the ability to play as a female character, a much more expansive in-game world, and contains nearly all of the cards from Base Set, Jungle, Fossil, and Team Rocket. It also features a more developed story in that, rather than just collecting cards and defeating the Grand Masters, the player must defeat a new villainous team, Team Great Rocket.

# Road Map

Some of the achievements are progression based and can't be missed, or done out of order, but many of them can be done at any time. The missable achievements are mostly events that open up and close at specific points during progression and battles with your Rival that you can only attempt once. They become available when certain conditions are met and you cannot avoid them when they do.

This guide will have the missable achievements listed first in the order they appear in the game for convenience. This will put the missable achievements out of order from the achievement list on RA. The rest will be in the RA order otherwise.

_Receive the Horsea Coin for winning the GR Island Challenge Cup 10 times!_

These cannot be obtained until after defeating Villicilli. Winning the cup 10 times in a row, without losing, isn't necessary. You only need to win 10 times total.

To get either Challenge Cup to begin, save your game in any location that aren't the Challenge Halls, Mason's Lab, or Ishihara's house/villa. After you save, reset the game, and check the Challenge Halls. Like Imakuni?, the Challenge Cups have a chance to begin every time the save file is loaded. It isn't guaranteed each time, though. Just keep resetting and loading until it starts. It's possible to have both cups begin on the same file load.

_Receive the Dugtrio Coin for winning 50 consecutive matches on Dr. Mason's Challenge Machine!_

![217204](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/assets/97459553/271c85aa-ab7d-44df-ab58-59e7fff10ce7) Gengar Coin

_Receive the Gengar Coin for winning 50 consecutive matches on the GR Challenge Machine!_

After defeating Villicilli, the Challenge Machine becomes available in Dr. Mason's lab, and the GR Challenge Machine on GR Island's Challenge Hall main stage when there isn't an active GR Challenge Cup. The machine tracks your "consecutive wins" after each trainer set of five you defeat. Saving after each set is recommended and resetting from a save doesn't interrupt your winning streak.

You cannot stop a set until all five trainers are defeated. If you do, your streak will be broken. The game will warn you before letting you quit a set. A lady will approach you and hand you the coin upon the 50th consecutive match win.

The opponents are random and thus widely vary in typing. You will fight three club trainers, a club boss, and a "main boss". Main bosses are: Ronald, Villicilli, Aaron (Mason's Lab tutorial trainer), and both of Villicilli's executives.

The easiest way to defeat each set with a single deck is to build a Legendary Zapdos deck. It consists of only a single Legendary Zapdos Lv.64 and many stalling/healing items. Zapdos has no weakness and its only attack bypasses Pokémon type resistance. Not having any other Pokémon in your deck ensures it will only hit your opponent's Pokémon since it can't target Zapdos.

The best strategy is to make sure you can get all energy on Zapdos as quickly as you can, use healing items as necessary, and try to remove energy from your opponent's active Pokémon as often as possible to keep it from attacking or retreating. Many trainers will open with a Kangaskhan and only attach one energy to it to use Fetch.

It's meant to be a stalling opener so they can draw the cards they need to fuel their deck. They'll start attaching energy to it for attacking after they've powered up their necessary Pokémon first. Since Zapdos' attack can target bench Pokémon as well, this AI programming gives you more of an advantage than it does them.

Here's the deck build I had the most win consistency with.

_Open all chests in the GR Fighting Fortress!_

There are six chests in the fortress that need to be opened. One of them only spawns after defeating Grace. There are many pitfalls that will drop you into the basement and back to the beginning.

_Receive a Slowpoke Lv9 from the GR Island (Red) Imakuni? after defeating him 3 times!_

Their decks are both mostly Water/Psychic. They can be challenged in a random club lobby, on their respective islands, once each time you load a save file. You must talk to characters in the Water Club lobby to learn about Imakuni? Black. Afterwards, both Imakuni? will begin to appear on their respective islands. If you wish to farm them for packs, save, reset, and check the lobbies until you hear their music.

_Get 10 Heads in the Coin Flip Combo Game, and claim Mew Lv8!_

It's uncertain if results are predetermined before each flip, like they are in duels, or if there's an actual strategy for it. Just keep playing until you win. It can take a few minutes or a few hours. At least you'll end up with enough coins to purchase all the things you need from the Game Center prize counter by the time you're done. Good luck!

**Note**: if anyone wants to look at the game's memory for the mini-game, to give a more definitive answer on if it's predetermined or not, let me know what you find and I'll update this information.

_End any match in a draw!_

Easiest way is to challenge Brandon in the Lightning Club using the Deck List below. His deck is the easiest to set up against due to 
damage resistance. Nicholas and Isaac use much more Colorless Pokémon and Jennifer uses Water.

Strategy Tips: 

* Play Diglett as the active Pokémon since it has resistance to Electric and Geodude doesn't.
* Build up to a Golem with enough energy for Self Destruct. Don't waste turns/energy building up Diglett.
* Use Scoop Up to return Diglett to your hand, leaving only Golem left in play.
* Work your opponent down to their last Pokémon using Avalanche and then Self Destruct.

Computer Search, Pokémon Trader, Pokémon Breeder, and Pokéball make it much easier to get what you need quickly.

It must be done while you have two or more prizes left to win. If the final Pokémon you knock out would allow you to draw your final prize, the match is counted as a win instead of a draw. If your opponent benches more than two Pokémon while you set up, reset and try again.

_Defeat Axel by obtaining all prizes without ever KO-ing his active Pokémon! [No In-Battle Save]_

Recommended Deck List

Strategy Tips:

* It's common for Axel to open up with Scyther. He'll attach single energy, Swords Dance each turn, and then prioritize his bench. This gives you time to set up and do some damage.

* His AI is programmed to fill his bench and set up Wigglytuff to use "Do the Wave" as soon as possible. Scyther resists Fighting so it must be the best option to stall with until then. It's not checking to see if your Pokémon can attack the bench directly.

* Try to remove energy from Jiggly/Wiggly when you're able. Use Gust of Wind to keep them benched if necessary. He usually won't bring them back out until Wigglytuff is ready or he has no other options. 

* Use Stretch Kick, attack his bench, and focus on knocking out Jigglypuff and/or Wigglytuff first. Then, go for whatever you want until you win.

* Computer Search and Itemfinder can be used to find energy removal cards, or return them to your hand, so you can keep him from setting up. There's plenty of extra cards you can toss away to use them.

* Recycle Energy is for feeding Super Energy Removal and Super Potions since it comes right back to your hand. It doesn't return to you if you discard it to use Computer Search or Itemfinder.

**Note: If anyone has a more efficient deck build, let me know, and I'll update this information.**

_Defeat Magician by obtaining all prizes without ever dealing more than 20 damage in a single attack to a Pokemon! [No In-Battle Save]_

Recommended Deck Build

Strategy Tips:

* Try to get Muk onto your bench ASAP and keep it there. It's only used for its Pokémon Power "Toxic Gas" to counter all of the Pokémon Powers he relies on.

* His AI is programmed to get Alakazam and Tentacool onto the bench as quickly as possible. Alakazam can use Damage Swap to move damage around as he sees fit and Tentacool can use Cowardice to return it to his had at any time. The combo is to move 20 damage to Tentacool, return it to his hand, put it back onto the bench, wash, rinse, and repeat until all damage has been removed from all of his Pokémon.

* He also relies on Mr. Mime's "Neutral Damage" to remove weakness/resistance. This lets him damage Colorless Pokémon and keep Psychic from doing much more damage than he can remove with the strategy above.

* Since the achievement requires to do no less than 20 damage per attack, it's extremely difficult to kill either one, but Toxic Gas renders his deck useless. It blocks all other Pokémon Powers as long as Muk is alive and well on the bench.

* Dark Persian's "Poison Claws" can get in some extra damage, since poison is done in between turns, and doesn't count towards the 20 damage cap for the achievement. Both are resistant to Psychic, making it easier to keep them alive for the long haul, since Muk keeps Mr. Mime from ruining the fun. None of his Pokémon can deal enough damage to get past their resistance without that Mr. Mime.

* Gambler's are used to shuffle your hand back into your deck, not draw cards. It's a battle of attrition and his primary goal isn't to knock out your team; it's to out last you. When your hand gets to 20+, use Gambler to shuffle it back in so you don't overdraw too soon. He uses four Nightly Garbage Run's to keep from overdrawing before you and the above strategy to stay alive long enough to do so.

**Note: If anyone has a more efficient deck build, let me know, and I'll update this information.**

_Defeat Warren by obtaining all prizes after playing at least 15 Trainer cards! [No In-Battle Save]_

Recommended Deck Build

Strategy Tips:

* You can start defeating his Pokémon and collecting your prizes right away. As long as you play 15 trainers before drawing the final prize, it's fine.

* The key is to crank out as many items each turn as you can. Draw/search items lend well to this, as do energy removal.

* A single Pokémon deck makes this much easier since you can cram a ton of items in it.

**Note: If anyone has a more efficient deck build, let me know, and I'll update this information.**

_Defeat Pierrot using Moltres' Wildfire to reduce his deck down to 0 cards! [No In-Battle Save]_

Recommended Deck Build

Strategy Tips:

* The Legendary Moltress is useful here since it lets you draw energy from your deck when it's played. You can fight the Grand Masters over and over to get multiple copies.

* Computer Error's are great, especially in the early game, because he'll usually choose to draw 5 cards, whittling his deck down quicker.

* You don't have to burn a lot of his deck down to win. You just need to make sure you use Wild Fire to remove the last card in his deck.

* He has some draw items, such as Bill and Computer Search, which should make the match move quickly. Keep his bench as empty as you can, heal as necessary, and wait him out. When the opportunity presents itself, use Wildfire, and call it a day. He's not too difficult to defeat.

**Note: If anyone has a more efficient deck build, let me know, and I'll update this information.**

_Defeat Toby by obtaining all prizes without your active Pokémon ever becoming poisoned! [No In-Battle Save]_

Recommended Deck Build

Strategy Tips:

* Taking him out as quick as possible is the goal. The only Pokemon in his deck are Magmar and Weedle. He has four of each in his deck so it's most likely he'll have at least one or two on his bench each time.

* It's common for him to open up with Kangaskhan, like many other trainers, in order to use Fetch and set up his bench quickly. Kangaskhan can't poison so it's great to have it as his active Pokemon.

* His AI doesn't really prioritize much, in comparison to other opponents. He doesn't have a wild strategy or anything. Generally, his goal is to get a Magmar or Weedle out onto the field and defeat you using poison. He doesn't always do this but will try if the opportunity presents itself.

* Energy removal, to keep his Weedle and/or Magmar from using their poison attacks is, very useful. Gust of Wind to drag his Kangaskhan's onto the field will help ensure that you won't get poisoned. He does have a few Switch's in his deck but, with a little luck, you can keep one step ahead. He has four Double Colorless Energy so remove them each time you see one if you can. They're prioritized to be played on Kangaskhan when possible.

* Zapdos shines here since you can nuke his entire bench with one attack each. Kangaskhan is the only Pokémon he has with enough HP to tank a hit. With good RNG, he won't be able to do much past that if he can't fill his bench.

* Keeping energy off of Kangaskhan so it can't retreat is a solid plan. It costs four energy to attack and three to retreat, making his only options to get it off the field are if you knock it out or he uses a Switch.

* Using Itemfinder to bring your energy removal cards back to your hand is great for keeping his Pokemon from doing much of anything. With good RNG, you should be able to take him out within a handful of turns.

_Defeat Frank using Pidgeot's Hurricane while he has no benched Pokemon! [No In-Battle Save]_

Recommended Deck Build

Strategy Tips:

* The only Electric Pokemon he has are four Zapdos, which don't really pose much of a threat due to the high energy cost to attack, so Pidgeot's weakness to Electric doesn't matter. His deck is mostly trainer cards and energy. He only has 12 Pokemon in his deck and no evolutions.

* Use searching items, such as Computer Search and Pokeball, to find your evolution cards quickly. If you already have them, Double Colorless Energy or Gust of Wind are solid choices.

* He has four Chansey and he'll prioritize them, if he can. He'll attach enough energy to Chansey to use Scrunch as a way to stall while he powers up the Zapdos on the bench. If you deal at least 40 damage to it, he usually won't use Double-Edge unless Zapdos is already powered up. He can use Scoop Up to get Chansey off the field, if retreating isn't an option, so don't wait until the last moment to start removing energy from Zapdos.

* Gust of Wind is useful in order to drag Zapdos onto the field, and Hurricane it back to his hand, if you don't have any energy removal cards available to you at the time.

* He uses energy removal cards but you should end up with plenty energy to keep Pidgeot at full power. While Wing Attack isn't the strongest, it should be plenty to whittle down his Pokémon until you can Hurricane for the win. With good RNG, you can get Pidgeot onto the field, and ready to Hurricane, before he can start filling his bench.

_Defeat Masquerade by deck out without ever picking up a prize card! [No In-Battle Save]_

Recommended Deck Build

Strategy Tips:

* Since the goal isn't to attack, Chansey makes for a great stall. 120HP and Scrunch make it very hard to kill. His deck is mostly Colorless with a few water and two Mewtwo mixed in.

* Opening with a Kangaskhan isn't uncommon in order to use Fetch and build his bench. He usually won't bother attacking with it, like most trainers, until he has all that he needs to begin his onslaught. It's meant to be a Fetch tank so he can draw what he needs quicker.

* Computer Error is great in the early game, as he'll choose to draw five each time, if his deck is still mostly full. That'll easily put you 20 cards ahead of the curve. Use your Computer Error's and Bill's to draw everything you need to stay alive, such as healing items and energy removal, and use Gambler once your hand gets too large so you don't overdraw before he does.

* Since the goal isn't to fight, Chansey is a prime choice because it's a damage sponge. 120HP and Scrunch make it very hard to kill. Pulling Mewtwo onto the field with Gust of Wind, since Chansey has resistance to Psychic, is super useful for stalling.

* Pokecenter is fantastic in this situation since you can remove all damage from Chansey in a single shot. If you have Recycle Energy attached, even better since they'll come right back to your hand, and you can easily keep stalling with Scrunch.

* Much like with dueling Magician, it's a battle of attrition, except Masquerade doesn't have any cards to refill his deck from the discard pile. Keep energy off his Pokemon, drag useless stuff off of his bench and into play, and wait him out.

_Defeat Anna after dealing at least 300 damage at once using Exeggutor's Big Eggsplosion! [No In-Battle Save]_

Recommended Deck Build

Strategy Tips:

* Her deck is mostly Psychic and it's another battle of attrition.

* Big Eggsplosion takes, at minimum, 15 energy cards to do the job. Since it's virtually impossible to get 15 heads in a row, you'll want to put as much onto Exeggutor as you can. I recommend 25+ for plenty of padding to account for bad flips. She doesn't use any energy removal so no worries there.

* Chansey can soak damage until you're ready but don't use it to knock out any of her Pokemon. You only get six chances to get 300 damage, if her bench is full, before you win from drawing all your prizes.

* Since Chansey resists Psychic, healing items aren't really a priority. At most, she can only do 10 damage to it per turn if she has a Psychic on the field. Use Gust of Wind to drag one into the open, if she puts out Clefairy/Celfable, and Scrunch for a little extra protection.

* Build up energy until you feel comfortable, swap in Exeggutor, start blasting away, and hope for the best. With a little luck, you should get it on the first duel.

_Defeat Mary after not playing any cards (except during setup) until your fifth turn! [No In-Battle Save]_

Recommended Deck Build

Strategy Tips:

* Her deck only has Water Pokemon in it. She'll prioritize getting Blastoise onto the field to Raindance as quickly as possible. She has a lot of item drawing/searching cards to speed up the process and draw a lot of energy in preparation for it.

* Opening with Chansey will help to soak damage until enough turns have passed. Chances are good that she'll have Blastoise onto the bench and her Pokemon will be ready for the onslaught by then.

* Use Chansey's to soak damage, get Zapdos ready as quickly as possible, and blast away. If you're having a little trouble, you can swap a Grimer/Muk into the deck for Toxic Gas to cancel out Raindance, and start using energy removal cards to drain her Pokemon back down to something more manageable.

_Record all 443 cards into the album!_

* The Legendary Zapdos deck is one of the quickest to farm with since Zapdos' attack is easy to set up, deals a lot of damage, and ignores resistance. This makes it extremely versatile in practically all situations.

* I've composed a list of all the trainers, where they're located, what packs they give, and how many.

* Each each card is organized the same way as the Card Album. You can Ctrl+F to quickly search for anything you need by album number. This way, you know specifically what you're looking for in each one. It also has every Promo and where/how to obtain them.

* Lastly, it has my recommendations for which trainers are the most efficient to farm for packs, based on what they give, how quickly/easily they are to beat, and why I recommend them. They're based on using the Legendary Zapdos Deck and you can begin farming every pack card as soon as you can access the Black Box. Read the "Legendary Zapdos Deck" section at the bottom of the guide to learn how to build the deck early.

* If you end up with a ton of chips, while grinding for "The Elusive Mew", purchase Present packs. They contain every card that's obtainable from all seven packs. It's a great way to get an early head start on fleshing out your collection, but has diminishing returns, making it less efficient over time. Spend extra chips on packs but don't bother farming more past that.

* The Black Box isn't really all that useful in the long run. It has few recipes to generate specific cards but it's not worth it otherwise. The list has all currently known recipes that I could find. If anyone knows any that aren't listed, let me know and I'll add them.

* If you did all the trading achievements, you'll have enough Bill's Computer's to get all five promo's without needing to purchase extras. It doesn't matter which card you feed it since each one will yield the same thing. Ex: if you have three different Machoke's, it doesn't matter which one you put in. You'll always get the same Machamp back.

# Legendary Zapdos Deck

You'd normally obtain a Zapdos Lv68 after "rescuing" Rod from the GR Psychic Fortress and defeating the Grand Masters. This isn't the only way to obtain one, though. It can also be made in the Black Box at the Game Center.

Black Box Recipe:

* Raichu Lv40 (Assault)
* Zapdos Lv64 (Premier)
* Dark Raichu Lv31 (Ambition)
* Empty
* Empty

This will result in a Zapdos Lv68 every time. Ambition packs, for the Dark Raichu, don't start showing up as rewards until the Fire/Water Fort. There's a small chance you could get one in a Present pack in the Game Center, though, allowing you to make the deck much sooner. The other two can be farmed on TCG Island.

Listed below is the build I used. I found it to be very consistent against almost every opponent. If anyone has improvements to the deck that they'd like to share, let me know.

Pokemon:
* Zapdos Lv68

Trainers:
* Super Potion x4
* Energy Removal x4
* Potion x4
* Gambler x2
* Super Energy Removal x4
* Gust of Wind x4
* Full Heal x4
* Computer Search x3
* Bill x4

Energy:
* Electric Energy x18
* Full Heal Energy x4
* Recycle Energy x4

Strategy Tips:

* Using only a single Zapdos ensures you'll draw it at the start. "Big Thunder" randomly targets any Pokémon that isn't Zapdos. You don't have to worry about wasting a turn nuking your own bench by accident if you don't have one.

* "Big Thunder" deals 70 damage, ignores resistance, and can take out any potential threats while they're still on the bench. Most Pokémon that opponents use don't have more than 70hp, making it a one-hit K.O. almost every turn. It's one of the fastest ways to burn through an opponents team before they have a chance to get their decks going.

* Gambler's are meant to keep you from accidentally overdrawing. They're a preventative against opponents that lean heavily on energy removal cards, such as Claire, and slow down the deck. Hold onto them until your hand is larger than 12 cards, at least.

* Gust of Wind's are great for drawing out high cost Pokémon, such as Kangaskhan or Chansey, that can't/won't attack. It makes the deck less reliant on healing items so you're not always scrambling to draw one.

* Computer Search is for finding Electric Energy if you get an unfavorable starting hand. You can search for a Bill but there's no guarantee you'll get any energy when you play it. Otherwise, use it as needed to grab energy removal or healing. It's more versatile than Energy Search.

* Recycle Energy is for fueling Super Potions and Super Energy Removals. It'll come back to your hand each time so you never have to worry about discarding a necessary energy. You can play them as soon as you draw them. Opponents will target your electric energy first since it's needed for your attack. Attaching multiples will let you play multiple Super Potions and Super Energy Removal's in a single turn if you have to.

* Full Heal Energy increase your odds of getting a Full Heal item in hand. Many opponents have status effect moves in their decks and you don't want any of them slowing you down by not being able to attack.

* Some trainer cards may not be necessary against some opponents. They're used as fodder for Computer Search in those situations.

* The deck can be easily tweaked for specific achievements like "Leave Axel Friendless". Swap Zapdos for Hitmonlee and Electric Energy for Fighting Energy. It's very versatile for achievements where Zapdos is too powerful.
