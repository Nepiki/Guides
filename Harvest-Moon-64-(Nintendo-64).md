## 2) Introduction

Harvest Moon 64 can be argued to be one of the best Harvest Moon games out there. The primary goal is to raise a farm and do well enough by year 3 to be allowed to continue. In the game you will grow crops, raise farm animals, you can get married and have kids and compete in festivals. Along with various other side quests in the game.

Due to this game having so many mechanics for dating and such, I will be including some information at the end of this guide for each of the marriage candidates and other information.

## 3) Walkthrough

**Step 1**

The first step is the play the game. There is a lot to this game, it is a game to be played over a long period of time The following achievements you should be able to get through normal play through, if you miss them before your evaluation, you should be able to get them as you continue. They are as follows:

**Step 2**
In this step, is basically everything that can be missed, or you can choose not to do. Typically, if you miss these in your first playthrough, you can start over and go strictly for them however since there is so much missible and you only have a single chance to get them, or you have to make choices, I recommend using another save file or, especially for the girls, get their affection up all around the same time, same with the rivals. That way you can trigger their marriages, then reset and reload your game and go for the next one. Therefore I am saying step two is your marriages because there are a lot of achievements that are affected by your marriage and who you marry. This method will cut down greatly on the time needed and the number of play throughs. If you don’t do this method, expect at least 5 play throughs. So as for the “cleanup,” the achievements are as follows:

## 4) Achievements

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138306.png) [Town Introduction]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99513)  
_Have the Mayor show you around town and introduce you to the villagers._  
**-=Missable=-**

This one is rather simple and just takes time. When you first start, when you leave your house, the mayor will be standing there, and you will talk to him. He offers to show you around town, accept and watch it play out. It will use up a few in game hours but it is not big deal. You will be awarded the achievement when the event is over.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138305.png) [Binge Watcher]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99514)  
_Turn on the TV and watch all the channels._  

Quick and easy, in your house is a TV, the most useful thing for me is the weather but there are multiple channels. Essentially turn it on and flip through them and you’ll be awarded the achievement.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138304.png) [Slacker!]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99515)  
_Take a nap during the day._  

Very easy, if you just stand there and waste away your time not moving, you will eventually lay down and start taking a nap. So just waste your precious minutes of the quick day, drop the controller and let yourself fall asleep. If you really want that time back, just save before and reload so you are not wasting the little time in each day.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138303.png) [Fresh Farmer]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99516)

_ Accumulate 10,000 Gold._

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138301.png) [Veteran Farmer]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99518)

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138300.png) [Master Farmer]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99519)  
_ Accumulate 100,000 Gold._  

Money is something you will earn throughout the game as you ship crops and animal goods. Just save your money and plant as much as possible and get your farm animals when you can. The more you ship, the more cash you get, eventually you will earn the money achievements as you go.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138324.png) [Giddy Up!]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99529)   
_ Get and name your horse._  

This can be gotten as soon as your first day and I recommend getting it then as well. You will need to trigger the cutscene anyway if you wanted to get farm animals anyway. All you need to do is head to Green Ranch, leave your farm and go south, and once you get there, it will trigger the scene. Get it, name it and you’ll get the achievement.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138327.png) [The Bird is the Word]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99526)  
_ Get and name your first chicken._  

This one is simply enough, head to Green Ranch and in the far-right building, enter it and you will have the option to buy livestock. Buy one, name it and you’ll get your achievement.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138295.png) [Poultry Farmer]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99449)  
_ Acquire 6 Chickens._  

Just as you did with the first chicken, you can buy all your chickens at Green Ranch until you have a coop with 6 chickens. Alternatively, if you want to save money, you can put them in the nesting spot in your coop and they will hatch into baby chicks over time. If you are buying, you can only get one chicken per day.  Also note, do not leave your chickens outside in the winter or rain, or you do not feed them,  they can become sick and eventually die. 

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138326.png) [Lively Livestock]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99527)
_Get and name your first barn animal._

Just like with the chickens, you can buy sheep or cows from Green Ranch. They are more expensive but their by products are worth more. Go to the ranch and buy either a sheep or a cow, name it and you’ll get the achievement.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138323.png) [Livestock Farmer]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99530)  
_Have a full barn of livestock._

Like others, you can head to Green Ranch and buy all your livestock, either cows or sheep, or a mixture of them will work. I find it easier to buy them as raising them from birth can take a very long time and close to two months before the calf is born and grown to be able to produce products. Also, like with the chickens, do not leave them out in the rain, or in winter and always feed them. Also note that you can only buy sheep, only cows can be impregnated.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138325.png) [My Animal Family]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99528)  
_Fill your Chicken Coop and Barn with animals._

Get 6 chickens and 8 barn animals either through buying or from eggs/impregnating. This will pop once you have the maximum number of animals you can get.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138318.png) [Cabbage Patch]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/125547)  
_Ship a total of 100 cabbages._

Cabbages are a Spring crop and takes 9 days to grow and seeds cost 200G. They take a longest in the season to grow but once you ship 100, the achievement will trigger.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138317.png) [Mr. Potato Head]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/125548)  
_Ship a total of 100 Potatoes._

Potatoes are a Spring crop that take 6 days to grow and cost 200G to buy the seeds. Plant them in Spring and after you ship 100 of them, the achievement will trigger.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138316.png) [These “Turnip” Everywhere]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/125549)  
_Ship a total of 100 Turnips._

Turnips are a Spring crop that takes 4 days to grow and the seeds cost 200G.  These are the fastest the grow and you can plant a lot in the season. Once you ship 100 of them the achievement will trigger.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138315.png) [Corn Maize]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/125550)  
_Ship a total of 100 corn._

Corn is a Summer crop that will take 13 days to grow and costs 300G for the seeds. The nice thing about corn is that it will regrow after 4 days making. So while it takes a long time to grow, you will get a continuous crop of it until the end of the season. Ship 100 and you will get the achievement.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138314.png) [Not for Throwing]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/125551)  
_Ship a total of 100 Tomatoes._

Tomatoes are a Summer crop, they take 9 days to grow and cost 300G. Like corn, they will also regrow and will do so every 3 days until the end of the season. Grow and ship 100 of them and you will get the achievement.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138313.png) [Egg Head]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/125552)  
_Ship a total of 100 Eggplants._  

Eggplant is a Fall crop and is really the only Fall crop there is. It takes 7 days to grow, costs 300G for the seeds. Like corn and tomatoes, it will regrow and will do so after 3 days. Ship 100 of these and the achievement will trigger.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138312.png) [Very Berry]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/125553)  
_Ship a total of 100 Strawberries._  

You can buy Strawberry seeds in Winter. However, to grow them you will need a greenhouse. They will only grow in the greenhouse. The seeds cost 500G to buy and they will grow after 5 days. They will not regrow. Once you grow and ship 100 of them, the achievement will trigger.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138311.png) [Shipped for Breakfast]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/125554)  
_Ship a total of 100 Eggs._  

For this, you will need chickens. The more chickens the more eggs you will get. You will get one egg per chicken each day. Keep in mind that not feeding them or leaving them out in the winter or rain, can make the sick and they will not produce any eggs. But once you get 100 and ship them, you will get the achievement.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138310.png) [Got Milk?]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/125555)  
_Ship a total of 100 Milk._  

For Milk, you will need cows. Only cows can be milked, so don’t bother trying to milk your sheep (or other animals…). You can get 1 milk per day per cow so the more cows you get, the faster you will get this. Ship 100 milk over the course of your game and you will be awarded this achievement.

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138328.png) [Tools of the Trade]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99525)  
_Fully upgrade all your field tools._  

All of your tools will upgrade over time as you use them. Essentially each tool will gain a level when you hit a certain number of times using them. Each tool has a different number of times it has to be used for it to upgrade, the number of times are as follows:

**Hoe:** 300 uses to silver, another 300 to gold.  
**Hammer:** 100 uses to silver, another 100 to gold.  
**Axe:** 450 uses to silver, another 450 to gold.  
**Watering Can:** 600 uses to silver, another 600 to gold.  
**Sickle:** 350 to silver, another 350 to gold.  

It is possible to get your tools to gold at the start of the game in a single night. If you head to the bar, time will freeze and you can jus go keep using your tools in the bar and they will get use towards their level up. Once you run out of stamina, you can order water and then keep going. This is tedious and time consuming but can be done. Personally, I would just let them level up naturally as you play but if you want them right from the start, you can do this.

_Have your child and get your picture._   
**-=Missable=-**   

To have a child you need to get married and maintain your high affection with your wife for at least a month so keep giving her gifts every day to keep her happy (Pretty sad… you gotta buy her happiness). Over time, you can tell she is pregnant as she will change what she talks about and eventually she will tell you she is pregnant. During the pregnancy, you want to keep her happy, otherwise the pregnancy will last longer. After the pregnancy happens and your child is born, you will get the picture in your album and this achievement will trigger.

**Note:** While typically everyone gets married when they play this game, it is possible to not get married at all and have all your rivals get married taking all the girls making this achievement impossible to get!

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138290.png) [Nuts of Power]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/125585)  
_Get all the Power Nuts._   

Power Nuts, also called a Power Berry, in this game are what will increase your stamina. There are 10 in total, and they can be found in various locations and through various methods. The methods are as follows:

**First Power Nut:** You will naturally get one just from working in your field with the hoe. It is random when it happens so there is no longing for it. It can be even on tilled soil though unless you are just grinding for it, it is better to just let it come naturally and only grind if it is the last one you are trying to get.

**Second Power Nut:** Fishing can get you a few. One is simply fish, one will eventually be caught.

**Third Power Nut:** If you catch a large fish, there is a pond in the forest by the tent, if you throw it in, an Imp will appear and give you a Power Nut.

**Fourth Power Nut:** If you catch a small fish, you can go to the pond in the mountains by the tent and the Imp will give you another one. This one is blue and you will use less stamina in rainy weather after eating it.

**Fifth Power Nut:** When you go to the mines and reach level 4, you can dig and find a Power Nut.

**Sixth Power Nut:** Win the Egg Festival and your price will be a Power Nut

**Seventh Power Nut:** During the Flower Festival, there is a travelling merchant dressed in black. You can buy one from him for 1000G

**Eighth Power Nut:** If you go to the Harvest Goddess and offer a vegetable to her in the morning, she will ask you a question, answer with Strength and she will give you a Power Nut.

**Ninth Power Nut:** In Winter, the fisherman’s pond is froze, there is a rock, go and hit it with your golden hammer as hard as you can.

**Tenth Power Nut:** You will need to plant flowers in your fields, you will need at least 8, I just planted one patch. Eventually a boy named Stu will ask for one but have no money so he will offer you marbles, take them. Afterwards, if you have not already, go make friends with the harvest sprites. When you get their friendship up enough, the one at the table will offer to trade a Power Nut for the marbles.

_Bet on one horse at the races and have it win (cannot enter your own horse)._   

The Horse Race is on Spring 17 and Fall 28, there are two horse races a year. There are 3 races in the day and I recommend getting there earlier than later because if you get there later, you may only get to do 1 or 2 of the races. Simply talk to the people at the desk and you will be able to bet on horses. Now, you can only bet on one, otherwise the achievement will not work. So bet on the horse that you think will win and watch the race. If your horse wins, you will get the achievement. If you don’t get it, you can always reload the day or wait until next race.

_Fully expand your house as well as have your Baby Bed, Cabinet and cloth your table._   

The Head Carpenter can be found in the mountains. You can speak with him, and he can give you extensions to your house for the cost of lumber and gold. You get the lumber from breaking tree stumps. For all the upgrades you are going to need over 2,000 lumber and will cost you close to 50,000G.  Just talk to him and choose the upgrades you want and eventually you will have all your upgrades. 
Not only do you need these upgrades, but you also need the tablecloth and the run in your house. You will need to go to the Flower Bud Bakery and enter a raffle at the end of Winter. When you buy a cake there, you will be awarded a point and the raffle costs 10 points to enter. So buy your cakes! You can also get the carpet (or rug) from Rick’s for 3,000GP.

To find the Harvest Goddess, you must go to the mountains, there is a clearing east of the carpenters with a little pond and a bridge in front of it. Bring a vegetable or an egg to the pond and throw it in. She should appear. The items must also be from your farm. Bought items or foraged items will not work.

**-=Missable=-**  

This is very hard not to do and you would have to pretty not do anything all, no animals, no wife, if you don’t talk to people, don’t sell crops or make any money, then you will get the bad ending. This however, can basically lock you out from continuing and if your most recent save is today, well… I hope you have earlier ones or you are starting over. If you want to make sure you get past this, make sure you at least are married or have some animals.

This will be done over time. The max affect for your dog is 255 and it starts with 0. To increase its affection, you can do so by picking it up, whistling for it and feeding it. Just do these things and it will be maxed at some point through your game. Keep in mind that if you hit your dog, you are a bad person and you will lose affection.

The Music Box is dug up in your field but can be hard to find if you don’t know where to look. First, you need to go to the tree on your farm and press A on it and you’ll find a treasure map, then you need to dig with your hoe and it is on the right side of the field from your dog house or if you go to the tree on your farm and go down. Really it is about the spot where the two intercept. You need to dig with your hoe at least 10 times and you will dig it up. Refer to the picture below.

In Winter, you can go to the mines and to find the weathervane, you need to get down to the 4th floor and dig. I recommend bringing something to eat or refill your stamina as the way to the next floor is not always the same and is random, same with finding the weathervane.

When you buy them, You and Popuri will plant them near the goddess pond. You need to water these every day and after about a week or so, they will bloom.

Buy the feather and give it to the girl you wish to marry and they should say yes. Now, this that said, not all the girls are the same, girl’s like Karen. With Karen you also will have needed to save the Vineyard (Outlined below). So to marry Karen, save the vineyard, get the affection up to pink heart and then give her the Blue Feather.

This involves befriending Cliff while keeping Ann’s affection lower. If Ann’s affection gets too high, you will not be able to trigger the wedding between these two. So work primarily on Cliff. The easiest way I found to get Cliff’s affection up is to give him eggs. If you are raising chickens, then you should get these daily. After his affection gets to a certain point, he will meet you outside and invite you to his wedding.

Gray is a quiet guy, doesn’t talk much and he is kind of shy, even when he invites you to his wedding though he’ll drop hints and such when he is close in the bar. However, all you need to do is get his affection up and the best way I found for that is to using eggs. He also likes eggs which are easy enough to come by. If for some reason you don’t have them, he also likes you showing him his dog. Once his affection is up enough, he will show up on your farm and invite you to the wedding.

The Egg Festival is on Fall 20 and while some may assume that this is a festival where you bring eggs, this isn’t the case. It feels more like an Easter festival as you more need to hunt for eggs. Go to the town square and talk to everyone and the mayor will start the event. In this event, the mayor will show a coloured egg and you need to go to locations where these boxes are and check to see if there is an egg. If you pick one that is not the right colour, remember that colour as it may appear later. But match the colours and the person who gets the most, is the winner.

_Save the Vineyard._   
**-=Missable=-**   

Saving the vineyard is a rather long process and is needed for a variety of events, and achievements. Without restoring the Vineyard, you cannot marry Karen, get Karen’s picture, cannot get the achievement for out drinking everyone and so forth and she will leave in Winter of year 2 and will be gone forever. So saving the Vineyard is actually a pretty important things to do. Follow these steps and you should save the Vineyard, keep in mind this is a long process:
1.	The first step is to really go to the Vineyard, watch the initial cutscene of Kai and Karen fighting.

2.	You next step is you need to befriend Duke. Duke is the Bartender, his favourite gift is Wild Grapes... however, those are not available until Fall. So you can essentially just give him gifts other gifts and talk to him. Even just talking to him will increase his affection high enough and he’ll give you a wine called “The Door of Heaven,” a wine that your grandfather wanted to give you.

3.	The next step is to befriend the Harvest Sprites. Now, I kind of recommend doing this in conjunction as the previous step if you can. They take a little more affection than Duke does which is why just talking to Duke should be enough. Now, the Harvest Sprites are located in the cave under Moon Mountain. When you start talking to them, they will not be able to be understood. Just talk to them, give them gifts, anything really works, I usually used foraged goods. Eventually he will begin speaking in English. Keep befriending them and talking to them. Once you see them mention something about wine, speak to them again and they will tell you about the Harvest Goddess and to go and talk to her.

4.	In this step, you need to have a crop or animal product saved, I used an egg. With this crop or product, head to the Harvest Goddess’ Pond and throw it in. She will appear and where she normally gives you three choices, you will see the option that says “Grape Spirit.” Choose that option and you will see a cutscene where the Harvest Goddess prays to the dead looking tree in the Vineyard.

5.	This step really involves you doing nothing except for going to bed on the night of Fall 6. When you go to bed that night, the Harvest Goddess will appear to you in a dream and tell you that Vineyard has been restored and that the Keif Fairies have come.

6.	This step is not really needed however, if you have your affection up with Karen (At least 120), she will come to your farm the next day and ask you to come, with the Vineyard restored and the Keif Fairies back, you will see a little cutscene and you will get her picture.

_Out-drink everyone at the New Year's Day Party and send them home. (Everyone must be present)_   
**-=Missable=-**   

At the New Year’s Party, there are several villagers there and every time you talk to them, you’ll take a drink. Each drink with reduce your tolerance. In order to out drink them all, you will need your tolerance up… a lot, at least 28 in alcohol tolerance. When you first start, you might be able to do one or two drinks before you pass out so you will need to get your tolerance up. The way you do it is pretty much buy and drink alcohol, usually from the bar. There is a better way however, buy a glass bottle from Rick at the flower festival, with this you can get wine for free at the vineyard in the shed. You can fill up the bottle and drink it and with you being inside the shed, time does not move making it so you can max your tolerance pretty much in a day.

Note: Everyone must be present so if either anyone is gone forever, for example Karen, then you will be locked from getting this achievement.

_Work your first year without getting sick._  

Fatigue is a hidden stat your character has. It maxes at 100 and you start at 0. Fatigue increases if you use your tool during the rain or snow, using your tools after 6:00 will also increase it so try and get your day work done early. It can be decreased by a variety of ways, using the restroom, taking a bath, using the hot springs and such. Also, there are multiple medicines you can use as well. If you can keep an eye on it, I recommend doing so, if you have a hard time, just try not to use the tool when it will increase it. All you need to do it make sure it does not get to 100 by the time the first year ends. If it hits 100, you will be sick the next day and will be locked from the achievement. So don’t get sick! If you can accomplish that, you will get the achievement on Spring 1 of year 2.

![Karen's Portrait](https://i.imgur.com/6qBFfc5.png)  


**Birthday:** Winter 29   

The Simplest way to get her affection up is really talking to her. This involves nothing except talking to her. If you are looking for her, her common locations are:  
-In front of the Carpenter’s house.  
-On rainy or snowy days, you can often find her in the Vineyard cellar.  
-Sundays she is on the beach.  
-Nearly every night you can find her in the bar.  

**Gifts**
|Loves|Likes|**Avoid**|

|Veryberry Fruit|Tomatoes||

### Heart Events

**Green Heart:** Karen is sick. When you reach green heart rating with Karen and it is a rainy day, go to the Vineyard and visit her. The event will trigger. She will be lying in bed and you will talk to her. Doing this will also increase her affection.  

**Yellow Heart:** When you reach yellow heart with Karen, it will trigger a dream event. There is not much to this other than just reading. It obviously only happens after you go to sleep at night.

**Yellow Heart:** Karen’s sprained ankle. When Karen is at yellow heart and it is a sunny day, head to the Vineyard. You will find Karen near the tree on the ground. You will be given the option to help her or go get help, if you help her, you will gain affection.

**Red Heart:** Blue Feather. If you have her affection pretty much maxed, she will ask you if you love her, if you respond with “Yes,” she will ask you for a Blue Feather.

**Special:** New Year’s Festival. If you out drink her at the festival, you will increase affection with her. You do not need any heart requirements, just out drink her, though I only observed this on Year 2.

### Little Secrets/Tips

1.	If you want to get her affection up quickly, grab your dog, go to the bar at night and just keep showing her. For some reason, she likes your dog even if the dialogue doesn’t sound like it. You can do this repeatedly and every time it raises it so you can max her affection in a single day. Of course, you may miss out on many of the heart events.  

2.	If you do not talk to Karen or befriend her much, you may not see her much at festivals, if you get her affection up, she will show up more meaning more opportunity to raise her affection.
