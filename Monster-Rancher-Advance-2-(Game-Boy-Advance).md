# How to get all monsters
## Introduction
The purpose of this guide is to help to get each monster in Monster Rancher Advance 2, because the information is spread between Gamefaqs, old posts in Neoseeker or in websites only accesible using wayback machine.
## Some notes
The game use a system of keywords (passwords) to summon a monster, the limit of characters depend on your Breeder rank, you can put any combination of characters and still get any of this monsters, but this list have keywords that are guarantee to give a particular monster.

For monsters like Devi, if the monster not have any parenthesis with notes, you can use either a fresh monster or a trained one.

Unlocking a monster means than now you can use a keyword to summon it.

A normal breed is any breed than is unlocked with the tribe.

A special breed is any breed than has to be unlocked after unlock the tribe.

Some tribes require buy some upgrade of the barn:

* Medium Barn: Arrow Heads, Golems, Lesiones, Psirollers.

* Large Barn: Dragons, Jokers.

## Unlocking the Tribes
Not all Tribes are unlocked at the start, here will be a list of all Tribes than have to be unlocked and how to do it, the rest are unlocked since the start of the game.

**Dragon**

If your monster is A Rank, you will receive an invitation on February Week 2 to participate in breeder training on March Week 2. Despite commonly held belief, you do not actually have to win or even compete in the FIMBA Amity Cup to receive this invite. It will still come on the following week. On the date of the training, take an A Rank monster to the AGIMA facilities in town. If you're unable to attend, you will still be able to next year.

Your task is to explore the Tapota Ruins to find an item hidden in an unspecified location (the Invite D). This item is located in a pyramid in the northeast corner of the ruins. The directions are: Up from the camp, right, up, up, remove the boulder, right, left, up, remove another boulder, and finally right. There you should find the pyramid housing the Invite D.

With the item in your possession, you will receive an invite from Bolzoi a couple weeks later to participate in the Dragon Invitation Match on May Week 3. Your sole opponent will be a Dragon named Warlord.

When you win, you will unlock Dragons for regeneration and also receive a DragFang, which can be used in combining to create a Dragon. You will need to have a Large Barn before you can actually raise Dragons on the ranch.

**Durahan**

Similarly to the Dragon sidequest, if your monster is A Rank, you will receive an invite to breeder training on August Week 4. The training will be held on September Week 4. You do not actually have to compete in the IMa Amity Cup to receive this invite. On the week of training, bring an A Rank monster to AGIMA in town.

You'll be tasked with finding another hidden item in the Tapota Ruins (the Invite W). It is hidden at the knight statue in the west. Its directions are: Up from the camp, left, down, left, left, remove the boulder, left, up, right, and finally right. You should find the Invite as you investigate the statue.

After finding the Invite, Bolzoi will arrive a couple weeks later with your invitation to the Durahan Invitation Match on December Week 2. Your opponent will be a Durahan named Deep.

After you win, you will receive permission to regenerate Durahans and the DblEdged, which will create a Durahan when combined

**Gali**

Gali can be unlocked as soon as the Malkt Ruins are available to explore. When you enter the ruins, travel east to find a stone pillar. Its directions are: Up from the camp, up, right, down, and right. Investigate the pillar to find some writing that mentions a god. (Note: this may require a monster with at least 400+ INT to trigger, otherwise you may find a scrambled message instead.) Afterwards return to the base camp and leave. You'll return to AGIMA where Holly and Karnab will report their findings to Mardoc. He suspects that the writing could referring to a Gali.

Return to the Malkt Ruins afterward and travel to the far north to find a trench. The directions are: Up from the camp, left, up, left, remove the roadblock, down, left, up, remove another roadblock, turn right at the corner, and finally turn up at the crossing into what looks like a dead end to find the trench.

As Holly and Karnab approach the trench, an ice bridge will then appear and allow them to cross. Follow the winding path, which is blocked by a glacier along the way, until you reach an altar. Investigate it to find the GaliMask, which can then be combined to create and unlock Gali.

**Gitan**

Unlocking Gitan simply requires that you win the annual Trident Open, which is open to A Rank monsters and takes place on November Week 3. If you place first in the tournament, you will win a BlkSpear which can then be combined to create a Gitan and unlock it for regeneration.

**Henger**

This sidequest involves collecting several key items from the Malkt Ruins: the Odd Part, Machine, and MechHead. This can be done as soon as the ruins are available. With the exception of the MechHead, the Odd Part and Machine can be collected in any order.

The Odd Part is found inside a cylinder-shaped temple in the center of the ruins. The Odd Part's directions are: Up from the camp, left, left, left, up, right, right, down, and finally down. There you should find the Odd Part inside the temple. The Machine is located in another cylinder-shaped temple in the southeast. The Machine's directions are: Up from the camp, up, right, down, down, down, remove the roadblock, and finally investigate the temple.

After finding each item, visit Chamois at the Studio to leave the part with her to study.

Once you have given both parts to Chamois, wait two months to pass. Chamois will then visit to give you an update on her progress. She has put together the parts to create a mechanical body, however it still cannot operate. Holly suspects there is a part missing and suggests looking in Malkt again. Chamois will leave the incomplete MechBody with you for the time being. Return to Malkt again and look for another cylinder temple in the northeast. The final part's directions are: Up from the camp, up, right, down, right, up, right, up, right, and finally up. Inside you should find the third and final part, the MechHead.

Return to the Studio afterward so that Chamois can assemble the final part. After the cutscene, you'll then be able to use the completed Mech Bot in combining to create a Henger and unlock it for regeneration.

**Joker**

Once you have a monster that is A Rank, visit AGIMA in town for a cutscene where Mardoc will ask you about breeder training. He explains that because of an irresponsible breeder releasing a Joker, the organization were forced to change their policies on restricted monsters. Following this, there will be another event that following December where Ayase announces that the Tapota Ruins have been closed for the duration of December and January. The cause is none other than the stray Joker prowling the area.

From that point on, Mardoc will visit every January Week 1 to assess your monster and see if it is strong enough to join the hunt. To be able to join, you'll need a monster whose POW or INT is at least 600 and has at least 200 points in every other stat. Otherwise Mardoc will return the next January. The Tapota Ruins will continue to close every December and January until you proceed.

At the Tapota Ruins, you will find the Joker at the monolith quarry in the northwest. The directions are: Up from the camp, left, up, right, remove the three boulders as you travel up, left, up, and left. The Joker should appear as you investigate the quarry.

Once you've beaten the Joker, Mardoc will give you the JokerMsk as thanks for your efforts. Use this item in combining to unlock Jokers for regeneration. You will need to have a Large Barn built first before Holly will let you proceed with the combination.

**Monol**

Monol's sidequest is available as soon as you can explore the Tapota Ruins. You will first need to find the monolith quarry in the northwest. Its directions are: Up from the camp, left, up, right, remove the three boulders as you travel up, left, up, and left. As you approach the quarry, Holly and Karnab will comment on the monoliths there.

Following their commentary, travel south from the quarry to the northernmost temple. The temple's directions are: Right from the quarry, down, right, and up. Investigate the temple to find the Monolith. Your monster's INT stat will need to be at least Level 9 (400 INT) to find the item.

Once you have the Monolith, Bolzoi will visit a week later to discuss your findings. After this, you will be able to use the Monolith in combining to create a Monol and unlock it for regeneration.

**Raiden**

On random months, the Peddler may visit the Square and offer to sell a rare item. One of the rarest items he may offer is the Nunchaku, which is used in combining to create a Raiden and unlock it for regeneration. This item is priced at 10000 G, but can be bought at a discount of 5000 G if you defeat the Peddler's monster in battle.

**Zan**

When you have a monster that is at least S Rank, you will receive an invitation on April Week 3 to participate in breeder training. On the following May Week 3, bring a S Rank monster to the AGIMA facilities in town. If you are unable to participate, you will still be able to attend the following year.

As with the Durahan and Dragon sidequests, you will also be tasked with finding the Invite N, this time at the Malkt Ruins. The item is hidden in a cylinder-shaped temple located in the northwest. The directions are: Up from the camp, left, left, remove the boulder, left, up, remove the glacier, left, and finally investigate the temple. Inside you should find the item.

Following the training, Bolzoi will shortly come over with your invite to the Zan Invitation Match. It will take place on August Week 3 and your sole opponent will be a Zan named Nagi.

When you win, Bolzoi will grant you permission to regenerate Zans and also give you the Ninja Bk, which can be combined to create a Zan.

**Doodle**

Before you can unlock Doodle, you will first need to unlock every other monster Tribe, including Raiden and Phoenix.

Once you have accomplished this, explore the Promias Ruins and travel to the far east to find an L-shaped ruin. Its directions are: Up from the camp, right, right, right, right, remove the roadblock, and right. As you approach the ruin, a cutscene will follow where a piece of Chalk hits Holly on the head. You will have to return to the base camp to keep the Chalk.

After obtaining the Chalk, take any Garu breed to the monolith quarry in the Tapota Ruins. The quarry's directions are: Up from the camp, left, up, right, remove the three boulders as you travel up (if you haven't yet already), left, up, and left. When you arrive, your Garu will start drawing on one of the monoliths with the Chalk. This event turns the Chalk into the OddChalk, which can then be combined to create a Doodle and unlock it for regeneration.

**Phoenix**

The Phoenix sidequest technically starts soon after you reach Breeder Level 1 (raise a monster to D Rank for the first time), when Canute challenges you to a battle and gives you the Flare Orb. Though the acquisition of the Flare Orb is crucial to this sidequest, it cannot be completed until the post-end game and requires that a number of other sidequests be completed first.

Before you can unlock Phoenix, you will need to do the following:

Beat the Emperor Cup.
Unlock Dragon, Durahan, Gali, Gitan, Henger, Joker, Monol, and Zan. (Raiden isn't required.)
After you have cleared the Emperor Cup, you can begin to collect the remaining Orbs needed to proceed: the Golem Orb, Hare Orb, MochiOrb, SuezoOrb, and TigerOrb. This requires that you raise the respective monster, usually to a certain Rank, until an event occurs where afterward you will receive its Orb. While you can begin collecting the Orbs immediately after you beat the Emperor Cup, you will still need to unlock the other monsters for the sidequest's second part.

Some of these Orbs can be obtained with hybrid breeds, while others may require a purebred monster. To be on the safe side, I suggest that that you stick to purebred monsters for these Orbs.

Golem Orb: To receive the Golem Orb, raise any breed of Golem to at least A Rank. Two weeks after achieving this, the ranch will then be attacked by a stray Golem named Gedo. Defeat the stray and Holly will comment how it didn't drop anything. The following week, the stray will again appear. Defeat it the second time and you will receive its Golem Orb.

Hare Orb: Raise a Hare to at least S Rank. Shortly afterwards, Bint the builder will come to your ranch in a panic. An incident has occurred at the Square and now an outraged stray Hare is attacking the merchants. You'll then immediately leave for the Square where you will fight the stray, Oceam. After it is defeated, the Peddler will then give you the Hare Orb in gratitude.

Mochi Orb: For this Orb, you will need to raise a purebred Mocchi to at least A Rank and take it to the Malkt Ruins. You'll know you did this right when Holly comments that your Mocchi is acting odd as you arrive. Make your way to the southwest and keep an eye out for a ruin that resembles a shrine with two statues. Its directions are: Up from the camp, left, left, left, left, and finally investigate the ruin.

As your Mocchi leaves to investigate, a doppelgänger Mocchi named Becker should appear. Defeat it and you will receive its MochiOrb.

Suezo Orb: The SuezoOrb is the easiest to obtain, as you simply need to keep any breed of Suezo of any Rank (this will work for E Rank). One week (the very next week if you only just regenerated the Suezo), Holly will say that your monster has gone missing. Your Suezo will shortly return and give you the SuezoOrb it found.

Tiger Orb: The TigerOrb requires that you take an A Rank Tiger to the Promias Ruins. As with the MochiOrb, you'll know you did this right when your Tiger starts to behave strangely. Travel to the southeast corner and look for a Roman-style temple. Its directions are: Up from the camp, left, left, left, down, down, right, remove the roadblock, and investigate the temple. Your Tiger should then find the TigerOrb.

Finding the Phoenix: Once you have obtained all the Orbs and unlocked the other monsters, wait until January Week 1 with a monster that is at least A Rank. If you have performed everything correctly, Mardoc will visit the ranch and wish you a happy new year. While everyone is talking, the Flare Orb suddenly activates and absorbs the other Orbs. Holly feels that it is pulling towards the Promias Ruins and you will leave to investigate.

Once there, you will need to find a round altar in the northern part of the ruins. Its directions are: Up from the camp, right, right, right, right, remove the roadblock, left, remove another roadblock, left, up, and then finally remove the gate with a red gem. Afterward you should find the altar and investigate it. The Flare Orb reacts and sets the altar on fire. From the flames, a Phoenix named Rampage emerges to battle you.

After its defeat, a cutscene will follow where afterward you will receive the Feather. The following week, Bolzoi will visit to ask about the Phoenix and see the Feather. Afterwards you will be able to use the Feather in combining to create a Phoenix and unlock it for regeneration.
