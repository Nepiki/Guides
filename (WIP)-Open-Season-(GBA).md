# Introduction

Open Season is a tie in game for the movie of the same name, released in 2006, and was developed by Ubisoft Quebec and Ubisoft Montreal. Open season received a total of nine different console releases from the Gameboy Advance to the Xbox 360.

While most of the console releases were not very well received by critics, the Gameboy Advance version was met with slightly more favorable reviews. IGN awarded this version the highest rating of all nine releases with a 7.5/10 and GameRankings giving it a 75%. No other port of the game received a higher rating than this one did at the time.

***

# Road Map

The game itself is fairly linear, with many of the achievements being standard progression. This guide will cover things such as Woo Hoo Bar locations, 1up locations, and strategy recommendations. The game does not track Woo Hoo Bar collection progress while in the levels and does not save any kind of progress until after a level is completed.

All achievements will be listed in this guide for clarity and consistency with the set on RetroAchievements.

### **Rabbits Can't Swim* & *Ducks Can Swim**

_Complete the stage Rabbit/Duck Land while flooded._

* These stages will become available after Beaver Land is cleared. They're the same stage as the non-flooded versions except they now have water hazards. Boog cannot swim and sinks very quickly while standing on floating logs and barrels. These stages are not part of standard progression to beat the game and are considered optional.

**Note: Beating this stage will flood Rabbit and Duck Land, even if they have not been completed yet. You will need to collect all Woo Hoo Bars in those stages prior to finishing this one. Flooding those stages will make many Woo Hoo Bars in them no longer obtainable.**

### **Dinkleman's Journey I-V**

_Complete (Animal) Land using only Dinkleman. (Roar is allowed)_

* The entire stage, from start to finish, must be played using only the Dinkleman attack. Special weapons, such as animals and gumballs, will lock the achievement. If the achievement is locked after using a different weapon, quitting the area and re-entering will reset the attempt.

* The Roar and Whistle from the item shop are allowed and will not lockout the achievement if used. Reaching the end of the stage is all that's necessary and they don't need to be completed on the first visit of the stage. Obtained when the screen fades to black before the boss fight area.

![11_Shaws_Humiliation](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/assets/97459553/4f6a703b-f55e-4446-a520-1ebb5ea64ced)

### **Shaw's Humiliation**

_Defeat Shaw using only Dinkleman. (Roar is allowed)_

The Shaw fight consists of three phases:

* **Phase 1**: Shaw will approach until in the middle of the room. He'll shoot the ceiling and a large plank, the size of about 1/3 of the screen, will fall. The ceiling plank is easy to avoid. If you get too close to Shaw, he will swing the butt of his gun at you as a melee attack. There's a sweet spot where he's within range for you to hit but you're outside of his melee range trigger.

* **Phase 2**: Shaw will now be wielding a frying pan. If you attempt to attack him with Dinkleman, he will always block. If you get too close, he will attack you with the frying pan. Stand in the middle of the room and wait for him to leave the screen. He will then slide across the screen, back and forth, three times. He can be jumped over and then hit once with proper timing. Attack after jumping over him.

* **Phase 3**: Shaw will now be holding a pillow and will spin rapidly. Stand against the far left side and duck. You cannot be hit in this position. After moving towards you and then away, he will jump. When he jumps, you need to jump as well, otherwise you will be stunned. He will move back and forth a second time before stopping. Once he stops, he's vulnerable to being attacked. If you have a full Roar meter, now is the best time to use it. It will slow down time long enough to deal all the damage necessary to defeat him in one cycle.

**Note: if a special weapon is used by mistake, dying will restart the fight and reset the attempt. Leaving the area is not necessary.**

### **Animal Land Challenge [m]**

_Reach the boss room in (Animal) Land on your first visit without taking damage._

* The entire level up to the boss fight must be done without taking damage or dying via falling into a pit. If either happens, you can retry by exiting the area via the pause screen and re-entering. Being hit by a hunter's stun dart does not deal damage and therefore will not cause the achievement to lockout.

* The achievements must be done **before** the area boss is defeated. Once the boss has been defeated, the achievement will lockout and a new play through will be required due to the game's auto-save mechanic.

* They can be done the same at time as Dinkleman's Journey in every stage **except** Beaver Land. There is a single enemy in Beaver Land that cannot be avoided. A duck that carries you to the next platform will pass directly through an enemy and you will take damage if the enemy is not killed with a special weapon as you approach it. Dinkleman, Roar, or a Whistle can't be used while being carried.

* Some of the other ducks may pass you through an enemy's hitbox if the enemy is in a bad position as you pass by. All enemies, aside from the unavoidable one mentioned, either cannot hit you as you fly by or can be defeated before being carried by the duck.

* The most useful special weapons for dealing with various enemies are the upgraded squirrel and duck. Be careful as you progress if you're not familiar with the level's layout. There are soda can traps in some stages that blend in with the scenery well. They can be safely disabled by using a squirrel on them.

### **Squirrel Land Boss Challenge**

_Complete the boss fight in the stage Squirrel Land without taking damage. (First visit only)_

* The fight consists of four tents with enemies that periodically come out of each one. The two types are axe throwers and shotgun shooters. Only one enemy will spawn from a tent at a time and stop not far from the entrance of it.

* An enemy in red will randomly appear from the tents as well. That's the boss you need to hit. After enough hits on the boss, the tent he came out of will collapse and no longer spawn enemies. It's best to stick to a single tent, kill any enemies that come out, and wait for the boss to appear. Moving around too much puts you at risk of being hit by axe throwing enemies. The boss spawns at other locations where you're not more often but he will eventually spawn in front of you if you're patient.

*Take out the top tents first. The bottom ones usually spawn shotgun shooters at the start and they can't shoot upwards. The top ones are more likely to spawn axe throwers and you don't want to be caught under one while waiting for the boss to appear.

*If you take damage, dying will reset the fight and the attempt. Leaving the area is not necessary to retry.

### **Rabbit Land Boss Challenge**

_Complete the boss fight in the stage Rabbit Land without taking damage. (First visit only)_

The fight consists of two alternating phases:

* **Phase 1**: The boss will move back and forth across the top rails while rocks fall from the ceiling. The boss doesn't attack so avoiding the rocks are the only concern.

* **Phase 2**: The boss will move down to the bottom tracks, coming in from the right side first. If you stand in between the broken segments of track and duck, the boss will jump over you. He will go back and forth before returning to the top rails to repeat phase 1.

* The boss can be defeated while he's on the top rail by using upgraded ducks. If you Roar, you can slow down the boss enough to get in just enough ducks to defeat him.

* If you don't have ducks, the boss can be quick killed on the bottom tracks by upgraded squirrels. Duck under him when he is coming from the right side, headed left. When he comes back across, from the left side headed right, throw two upgraded squirrels. This will instantly drain his health bar, even if it's at full.

*If you take damage, dying will reset the fight and the attempt. Leaving the area is not necessary to retry.

### **Beaver Land Boss Challenge**

_Complete the boss fight in the stage Beaver Land without taking damage. (First visit only)_

* This boss will fly across the top of the screen, dropping three sticks of dynamite. He will then come back across the screen but flying low instead.

* You can stand on the far right side of the boss area, where Elliot is, and the boss will not hit you with the dynamite. After flying across the top, he will always come back flying low, but can be avoided simply by crouching.

* A safe, but slow, way to defeat him is to use upgraded ducks. Throw one when he's at the top of the screen and then another after he flies past you when he comes back low.

* A much more efficient way is using upgraded rabbits. Same as with the Rabbit Land boss, he can be quick killed if you throw two rabbits at him has he flies past you when he comes down low. This will instantly drain his health bar, even if it's at full.

*If you take damage, dying will reset the fight and the attempt. Leaving the area is not necessary to retry.
