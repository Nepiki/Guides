# 2) Introduction

Welcome to Ed, Edd, ‘n’ Eddy: The Mis-Edventures. This odd union of Cartoon Network Studios and Midway Games results in one of the more interesting cartoon games of this era. The result is a puzzle platformer where you have to guide your characters to and fro with their abilities. And luckily, it doubles as a fairly easy master.
Throughout the game, you’ll play as all three Eds at once, switching between them whenever the situation calls for it.
* Ed can pick up objects and throw them. He can also use his formation, the Batter-Ed, to smash bulkier objects or run quickly.
* Edd (aka Double D) can activate mechanical objects, as well as hit targets with a slingshot. His formation, the Trampol-Edd, allows him to be launched up and over small walls.
* Eddy can stun enemies with stink bombs and use certain objects for stealth. His formation, the Tower of Eddy, lets the Eds cross narrow paths and grab high up objects.

A few helpful hints to start:
* Always keep an eye out for any objects that are glowing, as this means you can interact with them, usually with △. Ed’s objects glow green, Double D’s orange, and Eddy’s yellow.
* The best thing to do when you reach a new section is take out any enemies, as they can be major nuisances when trying to push forward. Be especially mindful of enemies that grab onto you (red squirrels, spiders, clams) and tougher enemies (crocodiles, dogs).
* Break things open! You’ll often get a coin or two, mainly from boxes and the like.


# 3) Walkthrough

[**Step 1: Story**](#step-1-dummy-step--total-points-999)

For this part, focus on completing every scam once. You can clean up any collectibles you want in this step, but they aren’t necessary.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/243260.png) **A Nice Cold Ed on A Hot Summer Day** (5 points)

Story related achievement. This scam is started when you begin a new game. If you need to do it again, simply go down the street and find a gate at the corner.

This stage is very straightforward, mainly consisting of moving from yard to yard and grabbing ice along the way.
* First yard: Break the cooler for the first ice cube
* Second yard: Break the next cooler (2), then use Batter-Ed on the crate in the wall.
* Third and fourth yards: Grab a cat in the third, then toss it at the dog in the fourth to reach another cooler (3).
* Fifth yard: Jump onto the picnic table as Edd and use his slingshot to hit Jimmy’s dolls. Bust open the fourth cooler.
* Sixth yard: Attack (or use stink bombs) to stun a few squirrels, then throw them into the window.
* House: Break down the door by throwing the fridge at it (releasing the 5th block of ice), then Batter-Ed into it.
* Rolf’s yard: After the cutscene, ram into the gate of the fence. Stun all three pigs and toss them into the pen to make Rolf move. Head to the shed and use Edd to turn it on.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/243261.png) **Ed Party** (5 points)

Story related achievement. This scam is found at the manhole in the cul-de-sac, right in front of where you load in.
Tip: Attack any large purple pipes you see. They’ll endlessly spawn rats until you do.

To start, move forward until you have to jump over a wall of barrels. After the ensuing cutscene, use the Trampol-Edd to reach the platform on the other side. Then use Double D to turn the crank and extend the bridge. Continue down the path until you reach a locked door Edd can open.

Keep in control of him so you can use his slingshot to hit a switch in the next room, then open another door. When the path in the following hallway splits, the fastest way is to hang a left into another room. You’ll find another ledge with a crank to lift Edd onto.

Continue down the path until you reach another chamber and a cutscene. Find and hit two slingshot switches, then cross the bridge to open the first valve. Jump to the revealed floor to find another on a low wall. The third and final valve is then reachable in a niche, hidden by some crates. When all three are activated, climb back up to the top and find Plank. You’ll get another cutscene and the valve installed.

All you need to do for the next area is walk up the ramps until you reach the arrow, exiting the sewer.

At Jimmy’s party, you’ll see three pinatas hung on the banners. Use the Trampol-Edd, then press X to reach and break them all. Once you do, you’ll get another scene and a boss of sorts will begin. In each phase, use Double D’s slingshot to hit the objects with targets, making them drop on Marie. Make sure to hit the other Kankers so they won’t attack. Hit Marie twice to make them all move somewhere else. Do this three times to complete the scam.
 
![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/243262.png) **Metal Gear Ed** (10 points)

Story related achievement. To find this scam, travel down the street and then down the lane. You'll spot a playground with the scam start at the far end.

To begin, use the Batter-Ed to break down the structure next to the fence, leaving a narrow ramp. After the cutscene, switch to Eddy and use the Tower of Eddy to cross it. In the next yard, take out the squirrels, then use the tower again to grab all three dolls and drop them onto the sandbox. Once Sarah moves, hit the table with the Batter-Ed so you can jump the fence.

Walk to the lot next to the yard, break down the structure on the left, and walk across it with the Tower. Repeat the process in the next area, then switch to Edd to lower the next board with his slingshot. Make your way across the scaffolds to exit the yard.

Cross the woods with the Batter-Ed to break through the fallen trees. When the path is blocked by a tractor, use the Trampol-Edd to jump onto the ledge on the right. Walk down to the other side of the tractor and activate it to open the way. Hit the bridge you passed with the slingshot, then cross into the schoolyard.

Quickly use Ed to knock down all the trash cans with the basketballs before time runs out. Move into the next yard, where bees are blocking the way. Use Edd’s slingshot to drop a cage onto Jonny to get past them. Climb the piles of wood on the left, then cross the plank with the Tower to slip past the dog. Use Edd on the door to complete this part of the scam.

Now you have to make your way back through, hiding from the kids along the way. Use the nearby box with Eddy to sneak past the dog while its back is turned. In Jonny’s yard, you can use the Tower of Eddy to hide behind the poles, moving between them when he moves past. Alternatively, run into the walled area on the left, then past him when he’s not facing you. To slip past Nazz in the schoolyard, hit the bell with the slingshot, or use another box to slip past her.

Jimmy will be painting in the woods near where the tractor was. Walk up the leftmost path, grab one of the paint cans as Ed, then toss it at Jimmy. When you exit the woods and find him with Sarah, creep up to them as Eddy, then toss a stink bomb at them. Lastly, you’ll have to get past Kevin in the lot. Activate the tractor with Double D, then walk with it until you reach the now open gate. 

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/243263.png) **Hut-Two Ed-Four** (10 points)

Story related achievement. To find this scam, go past the playground to an intersection in the woods. Make a right, then another right where the path splits to the construction yard.

The first few gaps in this scam can be passed with a combination of throwing barrels at boards and using the slingshot to knock down metal beams. Right before you reached a shut gate, backtrack to a path to your left. You’ll find a switch Edd can use at the back. Continue along until you reach another beam with a washing machine swinging across it. Cross it with the Tower of Eddy, carefully timing your trek. Break the wooden wall on the left with the Batter-Ed, revealing another switch for the gate ahead.

Switch to Ed, then hit the button in the front. Hit the targets that pop up with his attacks, making sure not to miss any. Get enough to open the way ahead. Climb up the crates, then knock the next two beams down with Edd’s slingshot. The wood wall on the left hides the next switch you’ll need him to flip.

In the next room, you’ll need to find all four power cells and carry them to the machine in the center with the Tower of Eddy. The ramp immediately to your left leads to the green cell, only needing a beam to be lowered with the slingshot. Also on the left side is a ramped structure with the blue cell on top. The foundation on the far right features a balance beam with the red cell at the end. Lastly, you can break down several wood walls on the right side to open the way to the orange cell. Make sure to drop them near the pipe that matches their color.

Head along the path until you meet up with Rolf. He challenges you to butt heads with his goat Victor before you can pass. The Batter-Ed will be your means of knocking him into the river. Cross the path until you find Kevin in front of a long racetrack. Start along it with the Batter-Ed to get an early lead, then run along it until you reach the end. Be careful to avoid any gaps that open up along the way, and you’ll make it to the end. 

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/243264.png) **Resident Ed** (10 points)

Story related achievement. This scam is located in front of the old house you passed on the way to Scam 4.

For this scam, you’ll need to grab three items and take them to the Kankers in the foyer. First, you’ll need something for Lee. Climb the stairs and Batter-Ed down the cabinet. Walk through the halls, crossing a wooden plank along the way, until you reach a pool room. Defeat the bats on the upper level, then go back down and use the Tower of Eddy to pick up a trophy in the corner. Carry it to the pink pillar on the upper floor to reveal the Ship in a Bottle. Open the door with Double D, then use Ed to carry it to the sisters.

Marie’s gift is next. Enter the door on the right and look for a hole you can toss Edd into with the Trampol-Edd. Open the door, break the cabinet in the room, and use the switch behind it. This will open a room behind a bookcase. Backtrack to it, then pass through the cave until you see a large incline. Walk up it and lift Edd onto the ledge above to turn a crank, filling the nearby chasm with water. Cross the bridge with the Tower of Eddy, then Batter-Ed the wall at the end.

Smash another cabinet, turn another switch, and use the Trampol-Edd to get into the hole that is revealed. Open the door and grab another trophy on a dresser with Eddy. Carefully cross the beams, avoiding the candelabrum, to reach another pillar to drop the trophy on. Like before, open the door nearby, then deliver the Axle Grease that just appeared with Ed.

One more gift, now for May. The door to the basement just opened up, so climb down the stairs and enter the adjoining room. You’ll spot a switch near a high bookshelf, which Edd can be thrown onto. This turns on the elevator in the first room, leading to another room with a high switch and a locked door. Use Edd on both of these to open the backroom of the library. Break down the scaffolding with Ed to reveal a narrow path. Carefully walk up in tower formation until you reach the highest rafters, where a third trophy is on the right and the pillar it needs to be put on is dead ahead. A well-timed crossing will get it there and reveal the Taxidermy Book. Grab it and take it right to May.

With all three girls satisfied, de-activate the saw with Double D to complete the scam.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/243265.png) **Till Ed Do Us Part** (25 points)

Story related achievement. To find this scam, return to the woods from the lane (or use the shortcut in the cul-de-sac and turn left), then follow the path ahead to the trailer park.

First off, you’ll need to power a gate with three batteries to open it. The red one is the easiest to find; just break the couch propped up next to the brick building, then grab the battery with the Tower of Eddy. The green one is in the fenced area to the left, accessible through a low section with the Trampol-Edd. Lastly, Batter-Ed into the car on the right to start a path to the yellow, completed with the slingshot. Once you place all three, you can open the door with Edd.

Follow the path until you reach Jonny reaching for a piece of the map on a fence. Hit the car near him to send him flying, then turn off the fence with the nearby keypad. You’ll be able to grab the map now. From here, the way forward is through a series of keypad-locked fences, each blocked by an obstacle or two. Toss Edd over a low fence to the first, smash another couch for the second, then cross either path in front of you to the third (I recommend the rightmost, it’s easier and has the chicken). 

Jimmy wants a jawbreaker, and you’re fresh out. Fortunately, there’s a substitute on the other side of a lengthy series of narrow paths to your right. Consider sending Double D across them alone so he can knock down all the beams with the slingshot. Then, carefully walk across in tower formation to the “jawbreaker”, dodging swinging tires and avoiding enemies along the way. Grab your prize, then return to Jimmy. Despite your trickery, you’ll get map piece #2.

You have to traverse the path behind Jimmy next. You can do this in one of two ways: the intended way, or the cheap way. The intended way is to steadily build the path to the far end with a combination of cars, slingshot bridges, and two paths you can knock down by lifting Double D up to the trailers. The cheap way is to use the Trampol-Edd near the ridge, cross onto the blue trailer, and jump onto the path. Since you have both map pieces, you’ll be able to open the door with no problems.

You’ll have a rematch with Victor in the next area. The only difference from before is the arena is somewhat larger. Once you knock him out of it, rematch him if you’d like. You only need to beat him once for the last map piece.

The following sequence is a series of timed challenges, each putting a skill you’ve hopefully mastered to the test. They all have the same goal: clear the way, use the switch to open the door, get through it in time.
1. Hit the bridge with the slingshot, Trampol-Edd onto the gray mound on the left.
2. Cross the path with the Tower of Eddy, then bash the couch with Batter-Ed.
3. Find all four switches while fending off several dogs.
4. Same as the 2nd, with only an added tire
5. Quickly run across this hall with the Batter-Ed

Time for the final boss, and it’s not an easy one. Keep moving to reduce the risk of getting hit by the Kankers’ kisses. Take out any nearby squirrels, then grab a garbage can as Ed. Toss it at one of the four marked pillars to disable the electrified water in front of it. Then, Batter-Ed into the pillar itself. Do this for all four pillars and the jawbreakers are yours!

[**Step 2: Collectibles**](#step-2-dummy-step-2--total-points-999)

If you haven’t already, return to each scam and find everything in it. Make sure to track down every jawbreaker, Easter egg, and costume piece. Also, complete both bonus scams if you’ve yet to do so.

Keep this in mind, you do not need to complete a scam to keep anything you found. All collectibles trigger an autosave when you get them, and you even keep the money you found if you leave partway. Take advantage of this whenever possible.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/243268.png) **A Growing Ed Needs his Sugar** (5 points)

This level has two jawbreakers:
* Blueberry: This one is tucked in the corner of the fifth backyard, where you shoot down Jimmy's dolls. Simply hug the wall on the right when you enter to find it.
* Black Licorice: At the end of the level, when you get into Rolf's shed, you can find this in the small pen to the left of the machine.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/243269.png) **Now With Zero Eds** (10 points)

This level has four jawbreakers:
* Tutti-Frutti: After the cutscene introducing the Trampol-Edd move, turn to the left to see a gap in the fence. Walk through it and this jawbreaker will be to your left.
* Red Hot: In the hallway before the Jonny room, you'll see two cracked white walls along the hallway. Break the one on the left with the Batter-Ed to open a room with a jawbreaker.
* Peppermint: After turning all three valves for Jonny, walk down to the lowest level of the area. You'll find this one hidden in some boxes.
* Bubble Gum: This is in one of Jimmy's pinatas. It'll always be in the second one you break.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/243270.png) **A Feast Fit for An Ed** (10 points)

This level has four jawbreakers:
* Root Beer: In the yard with Jonny, you'll find this behind the pile of doghouses. Note this is the only jawbreaker on the way to the candy store, and there'll be a gold coin here on the way back.
* Anchovy Paste: This one is held by Nazz in the schoolyard. To get her to drop it, hit the school bell with Double D's slingshot.
* Everlasting: Return to the path where you found the chicken (see Attack of the Fifty-Foot Ed). This time, you'll find this jawbreaker.
* Candied Beets: This is held by Jimmy near the lot at the end of the scam. Wing him and Sarah with a stink bomb to get it.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/243271.png) **Pick-Me-Ed** (10 points)

This level has three jawbreakers:
* Jimmy's Fudge: Complete the Whack-a-Jimmy game without missing any targets. If you succeed, the white door on the left will open, revealing the jawbreaker.
* Crayon Taco: To open the room in the generator area holding this one, you'll need to find and place all four power cells in the order painted on a wall: blue, green, orange, red. Once you place all four, you’ll be able to get it. 
* Chunky Puffs: During the final race with Kevin, you'll spot a wooden wall to the right of the track. Smash into it to reveal a shortcut with a jawbreaker.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/243272.png) **I Can’t Believe It’s Not Ed** (10 points)

This level has three jawbreakers:
* Kanker Ketchup: You can find this jawbreaker in the second part of the scam, next to a TV in the room you use Trampol-Ed to get into.
* Gingerbread Sailor: In the cave where you found the chicken, you'll later lift Double D up to a valve. The jawbreaker is right next to it.
* Sea Cucumber: After delivering the Axle Grease, head into the basement, then to the room on the right. The jawbreaker is hidden in a few boxes.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/243273.png) **Recipe for Homemade Ed** (10 points)

This level has four jawbreakers:
* Peaches and Cream: This one is hidden in a large pile of boxes at the end of the first section, right before the gate that requires two map pieces to open. 
* Pudding Skin: After dueling with Victor again, you'll be allowed to fight him again. Fight him three times for a map piece, a gold coin, and a jawbreaker.
* Buttered Toast: This is on a blue trailer in the first room of the basement, next to a rock you'll climb with Trampol-Edd.
* Gravy: In the third room of the basement, you'll spot this on a yellow trailer. Carefully use Trampol-Edd to get onto a nearby pipe to reach it.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/243280.png) **Don’t Get a Swelled Ed** (1 point)

The chicken is in plain sight in the third yard (the one with the cat).

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/243281.png) **Who You Callin’ Pin-Ed?** (1 point)

Early in the level, the camera will briefly zoom into a clam in front of a locked door. Hit it and toss it away as Ed, then clear the barrels nearby so Edd can reach the door. The chicken is sitting right behind it.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/243282.png) **One Small Step for Ed, One Giant Leap for Ed-Kind** (2 points)

On the wooded path on the way to the schoolyard, you'll spot a pile of boxes concealing a fallen tree. Batter-Ed through it to find a path where the chicken is hiding.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/243283.png) **Thicker Than a Plank of Ed** (2 points)

This chicken is on the path right after the generator room. The booth in the cul-de-sac will now play the Cartoon Network music video My Best Friend Plank.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/243284.png) **The Voice of an Ed** (3 points)

In the second section, you'll open a path into an underground cave. Immediately inside is the chicken. The booth, showing off the Eds voice actors, is in the corner of the street.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/243285.png) **In a World Where Eds Reign Supreme…** (3 points)

Shortly after getting the first map piece, the path will split. Along the right muddy path, you'll spot the last chicken. The booth, playing an extended trailer for the game, appears in the woods.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/243278.png) **Attack of the Fifty-Foot Ed** (10 points)

To get this, simply dig in the sandbox in each of the first three scams and collect the costume parts within.
* Cool Yer Ed: The sandbox can be found in the fourth yard, where you meet the dog.
* Pin the Tail on the Ed: This sandbox is located in Jimmy's yard, right in front of his house.
* Must Be Something I Ed: Jimmy's standing in this level's sandbox near the start.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/243266.png) **Edzilla, King of the Monsters** (5 points)

This scam is playable after finding the costume pieces in the first three scams (see Attack of the Fifty-Foot Ed). It is found at the front door of Eddy's house, a.k.a. the pink one on the right end of the cul-de-sac.

This level is very simple. For each of the first three islands, break everything you can with basic attacks. You’ll be attacked by tanks wandering the area, so counter by attacking, then throwing them. Make sure to then take out the small buildings creating them. When you destroy every building on an island, the bridge to the next will be lowered.

The last island pits you against a boss, the Kankerator. You’ll have to pick up and throw ten objects at it to win. Keep moving to the side to avoid its projectiles, and make sure to jump over the shockwaves it creates. If possible, try to slip behind it so it won’t attack. 

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/243274.png) **Would You Like an Ed with That?** (3 points)

This level has two jawbreakers:
* Queen's Choice: This is held by a statue of Jonny off the coast of the third island.
* Curry Surprise: This is found next to the bridge on the far end of the third island. Very hard to miss.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/243279.png) **I, Ed** (10 points)

Like the other costume achievement, dig in the sandboxes of the later three scams.
* Ed on Arrival: After the Whack-a-Jimmy game, you'll find the sandbox in the next area, tucked behind the containers.
* Nightmare on Ed Street: The sandbox is in the same room as the level's last jawbreaker (see I Can’t Believe It’s Not Ed).
* Ed Marks the Spot: The sandbox is in plain sight in the third basement room.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/243267.png) **Ed 2001: A Space Odyssey** (10 points)

This scam is playable after finding the costume pieces in the last three scams (see I, Ed). It is found next to the entrance to the lane, in front of the movie poster.

For most of this level, you’ll be without Ed and facing off against waves of robots. There isn’t a whole lot to explain here, especially since formations are largely unused, and most of what you’ll have to do are things you’ve done plenty at this point. 

Fight your way through every area, taking out everything that moves. The round green platforms will spawn enemies, while the antennas keep the turret robots functional. Destroy them both when you see them.

Any electric barriers can be turned off by Double D with a small keypad, which will always be within reach. Be careful though, some will turn back on after a short time.

When you reach Ed’s cell, you’ll find the switch by climbing the ramp on the right. From there, it’s a short trek and a few keypads to the boss robot. Take out one of the antennas to stun it, then activate as many keypads as you can around the arena. This will make the turrets attack it, as well as take its attention away from you for a time. Take this opportunity to blast it with Double D’s laser (a.k.a. his reskinned slingshot). Defeat the boss and the scam is done.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/243275.png) **Instant Ed, Just Add Water** (5 points)

This level has three jawbreakers:
* Australian Adventure: Hug the left wall of the stage from the start until you find this jawbreaker behind some barrels.
* Cantonese Paradise: Early in the level, you'll find a room stocked with large purple boxes. A jawbreaker can be found on one, hidden by a wall.
* Freezme: This can be found on a ledge at the back of the boss arena.

***

[**Step 3: Vintage Jawbreakers**](#step-3-dummy-step-3--total-points-999)

Last but not least, you’ll have to grind for all the money needed to buy every jawbreaker in the machine in the playground. This will take a fair bit of time, even after accomplishing everything else, so be ready to spend some serious time on this.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/243276.png) **Aged Like a Fine Ed** (5 points)

See Ed’s Got 99 Problems, But A Jawbreaker Ain’t One. For the first seven, you’ll need 71 coins, which you should be able to get throughout the story levels.

![](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/243277.png) **Ed’s Got 99 Problems, But A Jawbreaker Ain’t One** (10 points)

This will probably be the last achievement you get. To earn it, you’ll need to purchase all 15 jawbreakers from the candy machine in the playground. They are as follows:
* Italian: 1 cent
* German: 2 cents
* Scottish: 4 cents
* French: 8 cents
* English: 12 cents
* Latin: 18 cents
* Greek: 26 cents
* Swedish: 36 cents
* Slovak: 48 cents
* Canadian: 62 cents
* Australian: 78 cents
* Guatemalan: 96 cents
* Antarctic: 116 cents
* Mexican: 138 cents 
* Japanese: 162 cents

To cover them all, you’ll need a total of 807 coins. You won’t be able to collect that much in one playthrough of each scam, but there are two places you can grind easily.
1. Nightmare on Ed Street. There are three large cabinets that drop a gold coin (worth 25 cents) that you have to Batter-Ed to destroy. You can also just grind the one that appears at the very start.
2. Ed Marks the Spot. There are plenty of breakable objects, plus a few gold coins, for you to get. Focus especially on the flamingos, as they appear in clumps and drop a large supply of coins.
