Hello there, I'm Nepiki! I'm a gamer who has an unofficial case of amnesia so I have an obsession with writing everything down so I don't forget about it! Joking aside, I do genuinely like writing, especially if it helps out other people. I don't have a lot of guides yet, but expect to see more pop up in the future!

For everything me related, here are some links you can check out:

# 2) Introduction

Wario Land II is the second game in the Wario Land series, or the third if you count the Virtual Boy release. This was also a launch title for the Gameboy Color, being one of the few games that came as a black cartridge, indicating that it could be played on both the Game Boy and Game Boy Color. For that reason, there are also two sets for this game. While I am talking exclusively about the Game Boy Color version today due to it having more achievements, this guide applies to the Game Boy version as well due to the similarity in achievements.

Wario gets some well-deserved rest after kicking out Captain Syrup in the first entry, but she was out for blood. She invaded Wario's castle with her troops and robs him of all the treasure he has. Wario, loving treasure more than his mother, isn't happy with this and immediately chases after her to get his well-earned treasure back.

This achievement set was created by [voiceofautumn](https://retroachievements.org/user/voiceofautumn), using the Game Boy achievements as a base and expanding upon it. Most of the achievements are earned naturally as you go for completion, but there are also some miscellaneous fun achievements to partake in for the full set.

# 3) Walkthrough

[**Step 1: Story Achievements (including alternate paths)**](#step-1-story-achievements-including-alternate-paths--total-points-tbd)

This covers the story of the game, as well as every alternate path to find. After beating the game for the first time, a stage select appears with an easy replay button, showing what stages lead to alternate exits. Don't worry too much about achievements for this part and just focus on having fun and beating the game, as nothing is missable

[**Step 2: Power-up Achievements**](#step-2-power-up-achievements--total-points-tbd)

These will almost all come naturally as you're playing through the game, though some only appear at specific places and have to do with bosses. This part covers where the power-ups appear and what to do to.

[**Step 3: Hitless Boss Achievements**](#step-3-hitless-boss-achievements--total-points-tbd)

These achievements require you to do the bosses without taking a single hit. I recommend doing these on your first try (as ''losing'' does reset hit progress), or waiting with these until after you've completed the game, because you can instantly go to the boss by pressing down + a after selecting the stage.

[**Step 4: Miscellaneous Achievements**](#step-4-miscellaneous-achievements--total-points-tbd)

This part covers completion, coins, the infamous post-game time trial, and the post-game minigame.

_Defeat the Giant Snake_

Usually the first boss you come across (unless you took the alternate exit in 1-1 or 1-5), located in       
**Chapter 1:** One Noisy Morning        
**Story 5:** Defeat the giant snake      

Pretty straightforward boss, just keep jumping on his head and avoid getting bitten.
