## **Introduction**

The Xarnax Run is a challenge run in Zelda II: The Adventure of Link which is essentially a minimalist run. It is named after the first person to provide on stream proof that the run is possible, [Xarnax42](http://www.twitch.tv/xarnax42). Players of the Xarnax Run challenge are only allowed to obtain the minimum required items, spells and upgrades to complete the game. This requires creative routing and exceptional game play to pull off. It is among the most difficult challenges on RetroAchievements.

The following lists detail which upgrades are permitted and which are banned in the Xarnax Run:

**Permitted upgrades**
- all 4 Magic Containers
- level-2 and level-3 Magic
- Glove
- Hammer
- Raft
- Boots
- Flute
- Jump spell
- Fairy spell
- Reflect spell
- Thunder spell

**Banned upgrades**
- any Heart containers
- level-2 or higher Attack or Life
- level-4 or higher Magic
- Candle
- Cross
- Magical Key
- Shield spell
- Life spell
- Fire spell
- Spell spell
- Up Thrust
- Down Thrust

## **Routing**

The achievements for the Xarnax Run are ordered in such a way to guide players through the recommended routing. Many of the achievements can be done out of order, such as item collecting, however there are some deviations which will make progress especially difficult due to limited keys and limited uses of Fairy magic. Additionally, Three-Eye Rock Palace should be completed first the other palaces can all be completed without a required level up. In this palace, the player will get both of the only permitted magic upgrades as it is impossible to avoid them due to earning experience points from bosses. Doing other palaces first will force an unnecessary upgrade due to the how many experience points Barba gives.

To avoid accidentally ruining a save attempt, a trigger icon for the final achievement will always be present in the bottom right of the emulator to let you know that you are meeting the run requirements. If at any time the icon disappears, this is in an indication that you've obtained a disallowed upgrade and should immediately reset without saving.

1. Name your file XARNAX (This was a measure put in place to ensure that each of the subset runs unlocks only their appropriate achievements.)

2. Obtain the Magic Container in the cave south of the North Castle

3. Obtain the trophy in the cave in the Tantari Desert. Return the trophy to the girl in Ruto and receive the Jump Spell

4. Visit Bagu in the forest near the Moruge Swamp to receive permission to cross the river in Saria

5. Obtain the hammer in Death Mountain

6. Obtain the Magic Container at Spectacle Rock in Death Mountain
