# 2) Introduction

Pokémon Glazed is a [ROM hack](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=292279) created by Lucbui. It is a hack of Pokémon Emerald and features an entirely new region to explore, a return to Johto and also a few islands. The Pokémon all come from generation 1 to 6, and some improvements that have been made in later games are also applied in this hack.

**Do note: The achievement set for this ROM hack is based on the 7b version, and will not work for later versions.**

# 3) Walkthrough

[**Step 1: Story Achievements (2 missable)**](#step-1-story-achievements-2-missable--total-points-218)

What you have to focus on first is just beating the game. Since there are no missable achievements aside from failing to catch the legendary Pokémon, this should pose no trouble and the guide is not mandatory up till that part. Do keep in mind that the missable achievements for miscellaneous Pokémon are the Mudkip at the very start, and the Miltank in Johto.

[**Step 2: Legendary Achievements (all missable)**](#step-2-legendary-achievements-all-missable--total-points-240)

After the game is beaten completely, you have access to all legendary Pokémon. These make up for most of the achievements, so have fun unlocking them!

[**Step 3: Miscellaneous Achievements + clean-up (not missable)**](#step-3-miscellaneous-achievements--clean-up-no-missables--total-points-208)

Miscellaneous achievements that you might have missed during your playthrough. None of these are missable.

_Capture one of Cobalion, Terrakion, Virizion_

-=MISSABLE=-

**Requirements: Beat the Johto League and make progress in the story on Rankor. To access them, the HM Rock Smash is needed.**

Go back to Darkwood Town and enter the Darkwood Caves. Upon entrance, go east immediately and use Rock Smash to access a new cave where the trio is hiding. **Important to know beforehand is that there is no break between fighting each of the three, so you have to capture all three back to back. They also all have the move Take Down, so be careful with them killing themselves.**

On the Peaks of Alpha, there is another interactable monument that you can insert a password into, this one being "NOT ALONE…" (the … are in the "others" section). A new path has opened at the beginning of the caves, which will lead to Deoxys.

_Capture Arceus_

-=MISSABLE=-

**Requirements: Having captured/seen EVERY Legendary. This includes Darkrai and Victini, but not Latios, Latias, Entei, Raikou and Suicune.**

Darkrai can be obtained after having caught Cresselia. Go to Palmtree Resort and enter the VIP villa where Blake is waiting, and a cutscene will play. Victini can be obtained by defeating the trainer west of Seapray Town. Surf on the water until you reach a house at the end.

Upon meeting the requirements, make your way to Mt. Stratos and make your way to the top. In the same room as the entrance to the Fusion Labs, take the other entrance to reach Arceus. **Important to note about Arceus is that he has the move Perish Song, and will therefore kill itself within 3 turns. A Master Ball is very highly recommended here.**

_Receive an amazing price for catching 20 Pokemon in one safari_

Easily the toughest achievement of this set--probably even unfair. You have to catch a total of 20 Pokemon in the Tunod Safari Zone in ONE run. You only have access to a total of 30 safari balls. I can't help you much as this is extremely RNG-heavy, but I do have a few tips.

- There is no timer in the Safari Zone, and also no maximum amount of steps. You can take as long as you like with this achievement.
- The easiest Pokemon in the Safari Zone to catch are the Psyduck in the water, which are also the only encounter in there.
- Get close three times before you attempt to catch a Pokemon for the biggest chance of catching them. This of course does not guarantee a catch, but most of the time it should work.
- What I personally found to work for me, was that I've thrown 10 safari balls at the start and then decide if I want to continue. If I've failed to catch less than three times I continue but if not, I reset the game and start over again.

_Defeat The Champion Soul in a Rematch with A single Pokemon_

For this achievement, you have to beat all three champions with a single Pokemon in your party. This means that you have to battle your way through the Elite Four for Tunod and Johto with one Pokemon as well. There are probably very easy methods to do this that I'm not aware of, but this is what I have done:

I captured Arceus (a level 100 Pokemon) and made him obey me through the Obedience Master in Cianwood City. Then, I gave Arceus all the vitamins like Protein, HP UP etc. and also a Leftovers as the equipped item. The moves I learned Arceus was Thunderbolt, Flamethrower, Dragon Claw and Earthquake. I also bought all the stat-boosting items from the Goldenrod City Department Store (Dire Hit etc.). With all this prepared, the Elite Four and Champions were pretty easy to deal with. Make sure to bring a lot of Full Restore as well, as you probably have more than enough money by this point.

_Open your Pokedex inside Prof. Willow's lab once you obtain all 383 Pokemon_

-=MISSABLE=-

It probably sounds like a gruelling task, but it wasn't too bad. There are a maximum of 386 Pokemon, but Raikou, Entei and Suicune are glitched so therefore only 383 are required. Mega Evolutions and the Kalos Starters are not included in the Pokedex. Every Pokemon is obtainable in a single playthrough without any outside sources needed. For all Pokemon location, you can refer to the [Pokemon Glazed wiki](https://fanmadepokemonglazed.fandom.com/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Locations). Here are a few more tips that I have:

- Try to empty the Safari Zones first, as there are quite a good amount of Pokemon there, especially in the Johto Safari Zone.
- Almost every Pokemon is catchable with the exception of a few evolutions (starter evolutions and a few others). This means that instead of training Pokemon to their evolutionary state, you can also decide to catch them instead to save yourself a lot of grinding. Why train a Deino to level 64 when you can just catch an Hydreigon?
- Multiple Pokemon have become much easier to evolve. Feebas doesn't need beauty and can instead be given a Trade Stone to evolve. You don't need to level up Aipom during the night as there is no night in Pokemon Glazed. Only a few Pokemon are reliant on happiness to evolve, but most can be evolved by normal levelling or through stones.
