# 2) Introduction

Often listed as one of the greatest RPGs of all time, Final Fantasy 6 is the story of a young girl born with magical abilities in a world where magic was destroyed long ago.  The game boasts an impressive cast, quick combat and excellent music.  The set was primarily created by [cirellio](https://retroachievements.org/user/cirellio) with additional achievements by [televandalist](https://retroachievements.org/user/televandalist). Many of the achievements in the set are showcases of easter eggs or unique dialog, making a large portion of them missable during a normal playthrough. This guide will tackle the achievements in chronological order to get the most out of your playthrough.

_Watch the snowfield scene without skipping_

When starting the game, watch the entire opening credits without skipping.

_Destroy Whelk's armored shell_

Whelk is the first boss of the game.  The shell has 50000 HP, whereas the boss has 1600.  Attacking the shell will make it counter with a party-wide attack, but it only has enough MP to do this 6 times.  Heal between attacks until it runs out of MP, then you are mostly safe.  Keep an eye on your HP, while hitting the shell with Tek-Missle and Beams.  You'll need roughly 80 rounds to finish it.

_Steal a MithrilKnife while protecting Terra in the Caves of Narshe_

While defending Terra with the Moogles, use Locke to steal from the boss until you unlock the achievement.  If Locke's party dies, you can finish the boss with one of the other parties.
