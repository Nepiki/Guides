# 2) Introduction

Jaguar Bomber is one of its better games on the terrible Watara Supervision platform.  It is a simple shoot 'em up in which you must destroy as many enemies as you can across 4 stages.  There are no powerups and each stage is relatively short.  As is common for Supervision games, this game has so much cheese that it makes the game a pretty simple mastery.

# 3) Walkthrough
## General Tips
* Terrain and buildings will not harm your ship.  Enemies and bullets will destroy your ship.
* Flying enemies are worth more than land enemies.
* The left and right columns of the screen are generally safe from most enemies.  Most bosses also have a safe spot.
* Rate of fire will increase if you are closer to the boss or top of the screen (Max of 1 laser can be shown at a time).

_Complete Stage 1_
</pre></big>

The first stage introduces all of the enemies you'll encounter except one.  Most enemies will die in a single hit, though the larger ones will take 3 or 4.  Your ship only has one gun so there is no need to collect any powerups.  Focus on hitting the fliers first as they are worth more points and are more likely to cause trouble.  Most enemies will fire directly at you or fire downward.  The exception to this are the ship like enemies which fire horizontally.  Keep an eye out for these ships and take them out to provide safe passage.

The Stage 1 boss is a massive alien ship with an impressive array of forward facing guns.  Unfortunately for the boss, it cannot move and neither can its cannons.  There is a safe spot right between the outer cannons and inner cannons on both sides that you can place your ship in and fire at will on the boss.  Keep in mind that the closer you are to the boss, the faster your ship will fire.  The only surprise ship formation is towards the end of the level when a fleet of enemies come up from the bottom of the screen.  Dodge between them to avoid getting hit.

_Complete Stage 2_
</pre></big>

Stage 2 introduces an upgraded version of the flying enemies. These can be a bit more aggressive, but still are destroyed in a single hit.  Most of the level takes place following a road filled with tanks.  Most of the land based enemies will not fire unless you are in their line of sight, so use this to bait enemy fire and then destroy them after the bullet passes by.

The Stage 2 boss is bug-eyed floating head with a menacing grin.  It can only move horizontally allowing you to dodge its bullets with each.  Simply move left and right staying ahead of the boss to allow your bullets to hit it while also avoiding it's forward cannons.  When it is about to reach the edge of the screen, hop to the other side and repeat the strategy.

_Complete Stage 3_
</pre></big>

Stage 3 features another road, but this one splits off into different paths full of tanks and horizontally shooting ships.  These areas can have a lot going on, so try to focus on one side of the screen rather than trying to get both sides.  The tanks that seem destroyed in the center of the map can still fire, so watch out!

The Stage 3 boss is a ferocious dragon with bad breath.  It can only move vertically but boasts a lot of fire power.  Fortunately, this boss also has a safe spot which makes it a breeze.  Stick to the bottom of the screen and position yourself directly left of the bullet it shoots from its mouth.  If you are in this position, nothing can harm you (even though it will come close).  Fire away to victory!

_Complete Stage 4_
</pre></big>

The final stages features another split road with even more enemies than last time.  This is a good opportunity to get the rest of the score you need for the score based achievements.  If you need a breather, head to the left or right of the screen and keep firing.  The land based enemies will not appear here, but you still need to be alert for any bullets heading your way.  This level also has a surprise ship formation towards the end of the level.  A squadron of ships will come up from the bottom and destroy you if they hit.  Dodge between them again to avoid getting hit.

_Defeat the Stage 4 Guardian without losing a life_
</pre></big>

The final boss is a UF...Oblong?  This boss will start by moving downward in the center.  Hiding in the bottom corners of the screen will prevent you from being hit from any of its bullets. Once it starts to move in a square pattern, pop out while it moves upward.  The best way to hit it is to fire ahead of it as it moves from left to right at the top of the screen.  It has an impressive amount of HP, but eventually it will go down, earning this achievement!

Earning 80k points in a single run can be difficult, but the goal is not particularly tight.  Especially in the early levels, try to focus on the flying enemies, since they are worth 200 points compared to the tanks granted 100 points.  In later levels, especially level 4, prioritize the enemies that shoot horizontally, as they are worth 2x as much as the basic tank enemies that accompany them.  In some cases, it may be worth a risky move to earn a few more points, but keep in mind that respawning may take a while and can cause you to lose more points in the long run.

All levels have a safe spot about midway up the screen in the leftmost and rightmost columns.  While staying in this spot, enemies will fire horizontally just above your ship, preventing them from hitting you.  Be sure to continue firing to destroy any flying enemies that come from offscreen.  The number of points you earn using this strategy is drastically reduced since most enemies will fly by you unharmed.  This means fewer extra lives, but you shouldn't need them.  You may need to adjust your position slightly, such as when the enemies come up from the bottom on Stage 1 and 4, but for the most part this location is safe.
