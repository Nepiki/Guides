# Overview

### The achievements can be grouped into a few types.

- **Story Achievements** - these cannot be missed.
- **Collect Items** - Collect or buy certain items in the game. Non are missable.
- **Grinding for Max-Stats and Money**
- **Learn All Magic** - Learn all `Magic` in the game.
- **Beat the Arena** - There is an `Arena` in the `Caryards`. You need to beat all the stages.
- **Other Miscellaneous Types**

### General Tips

**No need to hire Shadowrunners**
- They die very easily and aren't that useful.
- The good ones are very expensive, and by the time you can afford them, you should already be strong enough to protect yourself.
- To avoid missing the second missable achievement.

**Save time for the max-stats achievements**
- Just grind for enough Karma to max one of your stat. Do not spend it.
- Save your game first.
- Spend the Karma to max that stat, to earn the achievement for that specific stat.
- Load your game, and spend the Karma on another stat.
