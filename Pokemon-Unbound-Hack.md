Pokemon Unbound is a GBA Rom Hack by Skeli based on Pokemon Fire Red where it comes to the stories of the Borrius region
Centuries ago, the Borrian people were enveloped in a great war with a foreign land. When all seemed lost, the Borrian king summoned a powerful force to help turn the tide of battle. Unfortunately, the war ended in defeat when the king of the foreign land unleashed a devastating weapon. Disgruntled, the Borrian army returned home.
The people, now enraged against the Borrian king, attempted a coup by manipulating the dark force summoned during the war. The Borrian king was able to seal away its power, however, and the coup was thwarted.
Many years later, an organization known simply as the “Shadows” seems bent on releasing the dark force once again. Are they after the destruction of the Borrius region, or is there something else at play? It's up to you to stand in their way!

# 3) Walkthrough 

## [Step 1: Game Settings]

**Some achievements can only be unlocked if a certain level of difficulty is set at the start of the game. In order to make all achievements unlockable on the first playthrough, set the difficulty level to _Expert_ when starting a new game**

### __Battle Difficulty__

**Vanilla / Difficult** | You can switch back and forth between these levels of difficulty as you wish


_**Expert**_     | Once you lower the difficulty below Expert, you can't go back up

_**Insane**_     | Once you reach New Game + you can choose this. From now you can increase or decrease the difficulty as you like. But there are achievements that require an active Insane difficulty
