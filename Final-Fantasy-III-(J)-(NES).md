## Story Achievements
No discussion on the story achievements here as you simply need to play through the game to earn them. You can't miss them!

`Share a Potion with a citizen in need.`

Considered a side quest as you aren't required to speak to this old man in the village of Ur at the beginning of the game. If you talk to all NPCs though, you shouldn't have a problem with getting this and the remaining side quest achievements.
