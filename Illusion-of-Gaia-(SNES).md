## Spoilers! 
Only expand the following if you don't care
<details> 
  <summary>Point of no return</summary>
   After beating the boss in Mu. Once you are in Angel Village you cannot access any of the previous areas.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>General location of the missable Stat Upgrade</summary> 
   In Freejia (Large town after the raft section) there is a Health Upgrade hidden.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Red Jewels Info</summary> 
   There are a total of 50 Red Jewels.

   The first 23 are missable after the point of no return.
   Of those first 23 there a few areas you cannot return to even before the point of no return so they become missable before that.
