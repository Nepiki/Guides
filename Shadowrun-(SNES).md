# Overview

### The achievements can be grouped into a few types.

- **Story Achievements** - these cannot be missed.
- **Collect Items** - Collect or buy certain items in the game. Non are missable.
- **Grinding for Max-Stats and Money**
- **Learn All Magic** - Learn all `Magic` in the game.
- **Beat the Arena** - There is an `Arena` in the `Caryards`. You need to beat all the stages.
- **Other Miscellaneous Types**

### General Tips

- The first missable achievement happens in the end of the first area of the game. So even if you miss it, it should not take very long to restart from the beginning. Before talking to `Glutman`, remember to sell your `Beretta` to get his `Zip Gun`. If you don't want to be stuck with the `Zip Gun` in the `Caryards`, just save before proceeding, and load your save after you earn the missable achievement.
- To avoid missing the second missable achievement, just don't hire any Shadowrunner for the whole game. Thet die very easily and aren't that useful. The good ones are pretty expensive, and by the time you can afford them, you should already be strong enough to protect yourself.

**How to save time for the max-stats achievements**
1. Just grind for enough Karma to max one of your stat. Do not spend it.
2. Save your game first.
3. Spend the Karma to max that stat, to earn the achievement for that specific stat.
4. Load your game, and spend the Karma on another stat.
