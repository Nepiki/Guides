# 1) Introduction

Welcome to the Shadow Hearts Missable Guide!

[Game Page](https://retroachievements.org/game/2989)

Missable Achievements: 25 out of 160

Number of Playthroughs needed: 1 (You can just redo the last bit of the game for a different ending)

Please read the [Forum Topic](https://retroachievements.org/viewtopic.php?t=18268) to understand the following: You need to play this on a fresh new game (Not NG+)

The game is basically split into two parts. While the first half takes place in a fictional, otherworldy version of Asia the second part and the endgame take place in Europe. 

Most missables are encountered in the first half because the story and area progression is very linear and you won't be able to return to earlier areas. So make sure to save in the beginning of every new area you arrive in.
The second half lets you travel around the world more freely and visit earlier areas, BUT there is some missable endgame sidequest content. So make sure to save before entering the last dungeon.

# 2) Before you play 

Be aware of those two achievements that require you to fill out the Bestiary.

```
[Collector of Monster Souls] (25)
Defeat at least one of every kind of monster that shows up in the entire game. Don't forget if you're on NG+ to claim a reward from Old Carl!
```

Fortunately the monsters are listed in the order of appearance in the game. So if you are missing a numbered entry from an area before, reload and make sure you have everything.
Apart from the main story areas and optional areas make sure you have defeated two special Wind Shear Types unique to the Shanghai Pit Fights and two unique to the London Pit Fights, clear the [malice](https://shadowhearts.fandom.com/wiki/Malice_Meter) once every Malice Meter Level to defeat four evil spirits in Asia, do the same in Europe and then they will be replaced by the Masks which are tied to an Ending.
This sounds like a lot but it's not hard if you know not to miss it.

Shanghai Pit Fights: No. 101: Prototype Wind Shear, No. 102: Custom Wind Shear

London Pit Fights: No. 103: Full Armor Windshear, No. 104: Perfect Wind Shear

Graveyard Asia: No. 105 - 108: Evil 1 - 4

Graveyard Europe: No. 109 - 112: Gust Eins - Gust Vier

Endgame: No. 113 - 120: Sword, Grail, Staff and Gold Mask (Normal and damaged type)

You can look up the full Monster List [here](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/459510-shadow-hearts/faqs/18841)

Take note that you unlike other achievements can also unlock this in NG+ in case you missed some.

[They Don't Need It] (2)

Receive a reward for finding the man's turtle in Dalian. Any reward for this is fine.

```
[Hiding in Plain Sight] (3)
Find a secret stash of cash in Dalian.
```

At the end of the events in Dalian go back to Sea Mother who hints at a secret stash and gives you the hint: "where the turtle looks take three steps". The hint is a bit more easy to understand if can read Chinese Characters. The restaurant is called 海龟饭店 (Hǎiguī Fàndiàn) = Sea Turtle Restaurant. Take three steps out of the door to find it.

```

Find a Third Key in the field in Dalian.

At a later point in Dalian the turtle search gets replaced by a digging mini game.

```
[The Temple of Treasure] (25)
Open all treasure chests in the Temple Ruins, Dan Tian Court, Jiang Palace, and Ni Wan Palace. Empty Chests are included.
```

There are 36 treasures. This can be very tough, but fun if you are a dungeon crawler. Don't worry if you don't get every chest before fighting the trial boss because you can come back (as long as you don't beat the next dungeon because that will end the Asia part of the game).

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/298034.png">

```
[Fighting For the Past] (25)
Win ten rounds in the Pit Fights in Shanghai as Yuri and obtain Anne's Cross along with a story of the past.
```

This is not too hard because Yuri is pretty strong. Make sure to defeat two Wind Shear enemies that are unique to this.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/299694.png">

```

```

The correct responses are always the top ones.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/299651.png">

```
[Sharp Eyed] (10)
Conquer all levels of the dog mini game and win a Monkey's Paw for your troubles.

Go down to the harbor to play this game. Another mini game that becomes unaccessible later in the story.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/299877.png">

```
[Cursed Treasure Hunting] (10)
Obtain all treasure in the Kowloon Fortress.
```

There are 9 treasures here. Remember to defeat every enemy once for the Bestiary. Defeating the boss without Judgement Ring fails also provides an achievement. This guide leaves those out because it's pretty self explanatory.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/300322.png">

```
[Picked it Up For the Articles] (1)
Find the Erotic Book.
```

Search Kuhai Tower to get this (It's in the same room you find the Red Phoenix Votive Picture).

# 4) Europe


<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/302063.png">

```
[It's a Surprise!] (1)
Give Joshua Halley's old slingshot.
```

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/302065.png">

```
[Now With Petrification!] (1)
Receive an Improved Slingshot from Joshua.
```

Talk to Joshua (The boy who stole your wallet) when you are in the hideout in London so you don't miss this. He will take Halley's normal Slingshot and give it back to you later, improved!

```
[Pulled from the Flames] (5)
[Fusion] Obtain the Destruction Stone.
```

Before fighting Albert Simon, the boss in the Nemeton Monastery Basement, you have to solve the torch puzzle by lighting all the colored torches and opening all the chests accordingly. Then you go to the well-like structure for the Destruction Stone to appear.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/301840.png">

```
[Yuri the Priest] (3)
[Fusion] Help the fighting couple make up and obtain the Water Gravestone for free in return.
```
You have to do this before going to the Neameeto Float. You can still get the Gravestone later, but to unlock the achievement you have to do this sidequest which is only available before that point.
Hint: Find the couple in the inn in Rouen
Spoiler: Go to the church afterwards and in the confessional tell him to buy a ring. Return to the inn and receive the gravestone.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/302064.png">

```
[Just Lying Around] (1)
[Fusion] Find the Light Gravestone in the weird house.
```
When you first enter Nemeton Monestary you can find this Stone lying around in the "strange house". Apparently it's missable, but I found it immediatly so don't worry!

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/302741.png">

```
[An Amazing Treasure] (3)
[Forbidden Texts] Trade for the Pulse Tract.
```

You need to complete the [Cave Temple](https://shadowhearts.fandom.com/wiki/Cave_Temple) and the [Ancient Ruins](https://shadowhearts.fandom.com/wiki/Ancient_Ruins). You also need the [Codex of Lurie](https://shadowhearts.fandom.com/wiki/Codex_of_Lurie) and received [Amon](https://shadowhearts.fandom.com/wiki/Amon) from Albert Simon (So you basically have to complete all of the optional endgame content). Look at the [Erotic Book](https://shadowhearts.fandom.com/wiki/Erotic_Book) on the world map. Now you can go to Roger Bacon and trade it for the Pulse Tract.
