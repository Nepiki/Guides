# 1) Introduction

Welcome to the RA guide for **Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge** for the PS2!

The game released in 2005 for PS2 and XBOX, developed by CAPCOM, and it proposes itself as a sequel to the 1993 movie, **Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas**. The game has some similiarity to **Devil May Cry**, like the combo ranking, level progression and secrets, although it is much easier to play.

The game takes place some time after the events of the film. Jack yet again gets bored of Halloween. He goes to Doctor Finkelstein for advice in how to improve the next halloween. The Doctor gives him his newest creation: SOUL ROBBER! A green slime that acts like a whip. Jack than decides to leave Halloween Town in search for new ideas, and leaves the Doctor in charge of the town. But Lock, Shock, and Barrel took this opportunity to revive Oogie Boogie, which then began his plot to take revenge, taking over not only Halloween Town, but all the other holidays too, to become the "Seven Holidays King". Sally manages to send a letter to Jack about what was going on, so he huries back to his town to fix the mess.

```
⚠️ The only supported version of the game is the european version. When playing this version,
the game will ask you at what refresh rate, or video mode, to play the game. Only select 60Hz to 
be able to earn achievements, as 50Hz is not supported.
```

# 2) Overview

[**Progression**](#progression)

These can't be missed and will be naturally unlocked by just playing through the game. While doing these, you should also go for the extras achievements, as this is the best opportunity to get them out of the way and to also get ready for the rest of the set.

Most importantly, you can decide to start on Nightmare Mode, the highest difficulty in the game. Despite the increse in difficulty, it is still manageable enough to get through the game. And besides, all of the challenge achievements will require this difficulty anyway.

***

[**Rank S**](#rank-s)

Most of the ranking achievements are about the A rank, as that's the requirement to be rewarded a figurine. Getting A rank is not that difficult, but getting S rank, especially on Nightmare Mode, does require you to go out of your way to reach their requirements. It needs to be done on Nightmare Mode for the The Seven Holidays King achievement.

More about how the ranking system works will be explained in The Seven Holidays King, and the A rank achievements will have written the requirements for S rank and some tips to get them. As long as you are at least close to the S rank requirements, you'll get the A ranks anyway.

***

[**Damageless, Full Combo**](#damageless-full-combo)

Everything regarding defeating bosses without any damage taken will be expanded with different tips to ease the challenges a bit. Nightmare Mode just makes it requiring more time to take them down with their increased health, so no behaviour changes fortunately.

Full Combos during the dance segments are also a part of this section. There's nothing much to say except for what to expect from them, but the buttons that are to be pressed are always the same, so at least the exact sequence for each dance will be written. Also, missing a button won't fail the damageless achievements if you were wondering.

***

[**Extras**](#extras)

Anything that doesn't belong anywhere else and everything regarding items, collectibles, upgrades and Hidden Places will be in here.

These should be done along with the Progression achievements; you wouldn't want to do these while going for anything else in the set.

***

[**The Speedrun Before Christmas**](#the-speedrun-before-christmas)

This final part will be entirely dedicated to the speedrun achievement, **The Speedrun Before Christmas**.\
A mini-walktrough on what to do in each chapters will be written for each chapter to indicate what is exactly needed to finish a chapter, or to show a faster way to finish them. Technically speaking, if you get S rank Time, you should be fine anyway.

# 3) Tips

* **Combos** - Soul Spin (↻ Left Stick, ▢) is your best friend to get combos. Another suggestion to do more combos is to taunt an enemy (Directional Button) to make them more durable, especially if they're already damaged to make them replenish some health.
* **Taunt** - Taunt (Directional Button) is primarily used to get exclamation points, and it can be used repeatedly on the same enemy, even if they are already in Oogie Mode, to rack up exclamation points. You need to wait for them to finish their "startled" animation first before you're able to taunt them again. A successful Taunt will also empower your next attack for more damage (similiar to charging up ▢ or △).
* **Blue Souls** - Not only will they increase damage, but when using Soul Cycle (△ Charged), use a blue soul when you see the Soul Rubber becoming almost red to extended the move duration. This is very powerful when in enclosed areas full of normal size enemies.
* **Pumpkin King Costume** - While it is a powerful costume, with Fire Bomb (△) doing very high damage, the costume is often used for puzzles and exploration, and it is better to conserve the Red Souls to avoid annoyance.
* **Santa Jack Costume** - The presents can be used against the enemies hidden in things to discover them and not be immediately retaliated. The presents can have different usages: Re-Possession takes them out of their Oogie Mode (they usualy always are when hidden), and Scared Stiff will stun them in place (especially effective against hidden Halloween Ghosts and King Ghosts).
* **Dodge Extension** - The Dodge (◯) has a tiny bit of invincibility that normally requires to be timed with precision to use. If right after dodging (O), you quickly change into any costume you have (L1 / R1), the invicibility from the dodgee is followed by the invincibility from changing costume extending it. Normally, changing costume has you standing in place, but this gets cancelled out when done right after a dodge, with good timing.
* **Infinite Red Souls** - Earning all the figurines in the game will reward you with infinite Red Souls for your Pumpkin King Costume. You don't need this, as everything in the set can be done without it, but if you want a little advantage for, say, against Mega Oogie, you can wait 'til getting this power before then. Also, the set doesn't block this you from earning anything with this power at all.

# 4) Walktrough

## Progression

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248483.png">

```
This is Oogie-Town [5]
Defeat Oogie Boogie's Shadow and recover the Halloween Door
```
`PROGRESSION`

* He will every so often throw dices at you. These can easily be dodged (O) with the right timing, or you can dodge them just by keeping walking left or fight.
* The Halloween Ghosts won't give that much trouble, but can be rather annoying. Soul Spin will let you damage them while also damaging Oogie Boogie's Shadow, and also collect the notes they'll drop. They can also potentially drop a Blue Soul, letting you deal more damage to Oogie Boogie's Shadow.
* When Oogie Boogie's Shadow starts to sing the WOW part of the song, the Halloween Ghosts will pick up bigger dices to drop them at you. Start to dodge them right when Oogie Boogie's Shadow sings WOW for the third time.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248514.png">

```
Damcel in Distress [5]
Defeat the Mega Spider and recover the Valentine's Day Door
```
`PROGRESSION`

* It has a weak spot on his back that when hit, he becomes many tiny versions of itself. Soul Spin is a very effective move here, as it'll attract the tiny spiders to you making it easier to hit them.
* Keep some distance from the spider, as he has 3 different attacks that he can do at random. Preferably don't stand in front of him, since he'll always turn himself to face into your direction before attacking.
* The web projectiles does not damage you, but will block you in place, even when the web is on the ground. He'll also start to spit 2 more projectiles when reaches half his health bar.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248515.png">

```
Cerebrum Cleansed [5]
Defeat Dr. Finkelstein and recover the St Patrick's Day Door
```
`PROGRESSION`

* The only way to damage him is to throw the pieces of brain on a tray to your left of where you star at him while his head is open.
* One way to open his head is to grab him from behind with △ until it opens. Then throw the pieces of brain right in front of him.
* You can also collect notes by destroying his machinery or even trying to open his head to open it.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248516.png">

```
Thanks for Giving the Door [5]
Defeat Barrel and his Army of Skeletons and recover the Thanksgiving Door
```
`PROGRESSION`

* He'll run around the arena and sometimes summons enemies. Follow him and hit him when possible.
* He can be taunted, which stuns him and lets you charge your Soul Robber for a high damage Soul Spin. You can do this repeatedly in quick succession.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248517.png">

```
Trick or Treat! [5]
Defeat Lock, Shock and Barrel and recover the Independence Day Door
```
`PROGRESSION`

If you hit them with the bear traps, they'll be stuck in place for some free hits. Be aware that they can still attack while immobilized.

* When the bathtub is destroyed, all three will get off of it and attack you. Of the 3, Shock is the most dangerous one, as her attack is kind of hard to avoid. They'll run away when you'r going after them, so try your best to go after Shock.
* Fire Blast from the Pumpkin King Costume is very useful here. It'll blast them off in the air while also dealing high damage. If you can, try to hit all of them in one blast.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248518.png">

```
Boogeyman's Wager [10]
Defeat Oogie Boogie and recover the Easter Door
```
`PROGRESSION`

Stay close to the central platform and destroy the cards immediately as they appear. Back off the platform a bit after destroying one of them or you'll get hit by the blades of the central platform.

The gunners can be destroyed and if done so will damage Oogie Boogie for a bit of damage. You can either go for them, or just go to the opposite side of the arena to not get hit.

After the gunners, the cards will appear again. Then exploding dices will appear that need to be disposed immediately by grabbing and throwing them away.

After this, the dices will appear again, but they won't explode immediately this time. At this moment, Oogie will sing the WOW part of the song, and he'll have his mouth wide open whenever he sings WOW. Throw the dices at him when his mouth is open and stay right on the empty spot where the dice was to avoid the explosions. After the third WOW, Oogie will explode, taking damage and stunned for a bit, making him vulnerable to some damage. If you don't, it won't be possible to damage him.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248519.png">

```
A Dance of Fire and Ice [10]
Defeat the Fire King and Ice King Skeletons and recover the Christmas Door
```
`PROGRESSION`

Both the Fire King Skeleton and the Ice King Skeleton are basically bigger King Skeletons, so just like them the best way to defeat them is to attack them from behind.

Ice King Skeleton will go down very easily via Fire Blast from the Pumpkin King Costume. Don't use the costume against the Fire King Skeleton or it'll heal from it.

When either of them turns dark, use Santa Jack's Re-Possession present to turn them back to normal.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248520.png">

```
Father Christmas' Sorrow [10]
Defeat the Oogie Train to save Sandy
```
`PROGRESSION`

Make it a priority to hit the lever closest to where the train is coming from to not get it to Santa Claus. A red light will signal you which one it is that you need to hit.

The area is full of hidden enemies that make traversing anywhere a challenge. Either attack them at a safe distance or use a Re-Possession present on them.

While thashing the Oogie Train, remember to not stand in front of it or you'll take damage and be knocked down.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248521.png">

```
You're King Of Nothing! [25]
Defeat Mega Oogie and save all of the Holidays!
```
`COMPLETION`

You can hit his feet to make him fall (get away from where he falls!). This makes his head reachable with your attacks but be aware that staying on the ground makes it easy to be targeted by his attacks.

You can also get on the upper part of the arena and make him come closer to the gas leaks. When close, light them up with any attack from the Pumpkin King Costume for a good amount of damage. The gas leaks will reappear after a while.

He always makes a sound when ready to attack. If he's close, he'll try to smack you. It requires a precise dodge timing to dodge it, but you can also try to walk away from him if he tries. Another attack is him throwing up objects at you. It's sort of difficult to dodge this one because of how fast they'll fly at you. You'll have more possibility to dodge its attack the further away you're from him. You can also drop down the arena or get in the upper floor to make him stop the attack while he's executing it.

After the fight, you'll transition into a dance sequence. This one is the hardest in the game, and anytime you miss a button you'll lose health. The last parts in the dance are hard to do correctly, so they'll most likely cost you some health. As long as you have enough health to go through this, you'll be fine.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248701.png">

```
Jack Must Die! [25]
Beat the game on Nightmare Mode
```
`COMPLETION`

You'll earn this after beating chapter 24 on Nightmare Mode.

That wasn't so bad... right?

## Rank S

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248562.png">

```
Jack's Return [5]
Get an "A" or higher in all Ranks in Chapter 1
```
`PROGRESSION`

* Time: 8:00
* Combo: 120
* Damage: 4
* !-Count: 30

If you don't waste time anywhere else, like saving to game or going into the Hidden Place, and go straight to Oogie Boogie's Shadow, you won't have any problems with time.

Bundle the Skeletons together and Soul Spin them until less than half health. Then Taunt to get them into Oogie Mode (you may need to hit them right after to keep the combo going) and Soul Spin again for even more combos. You should also defeat one Skeleton earlier, so that when the transformed ones are defeated you can hit this one while you wait for the others to spawn.

You can constantly taunt the Skeletons to get many exclamation marks. Otherwise, just do a Full Combo dance against Oogie Boogie's Shadow to get the exact amount needed.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248563.png">

```
The Witching Hour [5]
Get an "A" or higher in all Ranks in Chapter 2
```
`PROGRESSION`

* Time: 5:00
* Combo: 100
* Damage: 4
* !-Count: 5

This is a short chapter, as long as you ignore any fights in town. The only fights you're needed to do is the one in the sewer and the one in front of the gate after speaking with the Clown in the sewer. The number of enemies in front of the gate can be at random, but not a problem at all.

Use the enemies in the sewer for combos. You could use Soul Cycle here, but it won't let you reach the 100 combo required, so just Soul Spin and taunt them. You can always use the enemies in front of the gate if unable to do it there.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248564.png">

```
The Hanging Tree [5]
Get an "A" or higher in all Ranks in Chapter 3
```
`PROGRESSION`

* Time: 11:00
* Combo: 280
* Damage: 4
* !-Count: 30

Know beforehand the location of the Hanging Men to make time a non-issue. Though you do have some leniency with time here, and Zero helps you by locating them. Remember to speak to the Hanging Tree when you find all 5 of them.

Soul Cycle during the Lock fight is the best, and probably the only place where you can achieve the combo amount needed, and to also get the exclamation marks needed. Whenever Soul Robber starts to become red, use a Blue Soul to replenish its duration. Do this until you use up all your Blue Souls or few enemies remain, then just Soul Spin and Taunt the remaining ones.

Soul Cycle during Lock's Fight also makes not taking damage much easier. Only other risky place is when going through the statues that spit flames in the second section of the graveyard. Take your time when passing through them (dodging won't work here), and make sure no enemies are following you while going through here.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248565.png">

```
Grave Danger [5]
Get an "A" or higher in all Ranks in Chapter 4
```
`PROGRESSION`

* Time: 7:00
* Combo: 100
* Damage: 8
* !-Count: 25

Just like with the Hanging Men, know beforehand the location of all the tombstones. They can be located with purple souls coming out of them. Also remember to speak to the Hanging Tree when done.

You shouldn't have any problems going through any fights and get to the combos and exclamation marks required. One good fight to go to is the one in front of the entrance to the next section of the graveyard.

The Skeleton Troll is a good target for combos, especially when it drops its mace for some easy Soul Spins. If you Taunt it, rather then immediately attacking it'll stand in place to make a loud noise. You can still hit it while it does so, but you can taunt it again the moment he's finished with the loud noise to keep it in place there. This is good to keep also keep a low damage count, as it is actually a bit dangerous.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248680.png">

```
The Crypt Creeper [5]
Get an "A" or higher in all Ranks in Chapter 5
```
`PROGRESSION`

* Time: 9:00
* Combo: 59
* Damage: 8
* !-Count: 59

The Lock boss fight will most likely waste you some time here. If you get close to him fast enough, you can stun him by Taunting, then hit him with a Soul Spin and then repeat. Otherwise, catch him while in the air and engage the Skeletons only if they're too close. Lock will jump up in the air to attack you from above. If a shadow appears underneath you, dodge out of the shadow.

All the combo and exclamation marks can be done during the dance segment against the Super Spider. During the fight, be patient and dodge until a good opportunity to hit its weakspot shows up. After hitting its weakspot, charge Soul Robber with Square, then when the tiny spiders appear, perform a Soul Spin to hit most of them to be on time.

Bone Chilling [5]
Beat the game with an overall ranking of "C" or higher
```
`COMPLETION`

```
The Pumpkin King [25]
Beat the game with an overall ranking of "A" or higher on Nightmare Mode
```
`COMPLETION`

See **The Seven Holidays King** for more information.

You're likely to earn this and the others first if you didn't complete the secret chapters when beating the game. You can always do them at your leisure, even after beating the game.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248703.png">

```
The Seven Holidays King [50]
Beat the game with an overall "S" ranking on all levels and successfully complete both
secret chapters on Nightmare Mode
```
`COMPLETION`

When you beat a level, the game will rank you based on different categories, and then give you a total rank of the chapter.
* Time: how much time you spent to beat the level.
* Combo: Highest combo number without breaking it.
* Damage: Amount of hits taken.
* !-Count: These can be earned by taunting, using Santa Jack's presents, and during dances by pressing the correct buttons.

The total ranking in a chapter is determined by the highest ranking in each of the categories. It is not based on just the final ranking you achieve at the end of the chapter through the ranking screen, but rather the highest one reached in any category. Say you got S ranks in Combo, Damage, and !-Count, but D in Time; Replaying that chapter and earning S rank in Time will add it up to the other S ranks you already got to give you an overrall S rank in that chapter.

While getting a total S rank in the game requires both earning all S ranks in each chapter and complete both the Secret Chapters completed. Not only this, but you're also needed to do this on Nightmare Mode, which have more strict requirements for S ranks, and also give you 1 extra point in damage whenever you take a hit.

```
⚠️ Be aware that if you are going for the Secret Chapters, any hits taken or any amount of time-
spent in these secret chapters will count for the rankings in the main chapters, as you're technically- 
still inside it. If you're going for the Secret Chapters while also going for S ranks, know that- 
at least the Time rank is almost impossible to do in both chapters.
```

## Damageless, Full Combo

```
Skellinton's Revenge [10]
Defeat Oogie's Boogie's Shadow without taking damage on Nightmare Mode
```
`CHALLENGE`

He does a very clear movement when he throws his dices.

The Halloween Ghosts can easily be dealt with with Soul Spin. Unless they're getting annoying, ignore them.

When at the WOW part of the song, be ready to dodge in time the big dices, right when Oogie Boogie's Shadow gets at the third WOW. It may be safer to get away from them with a triple dodge.

```
`CHALLENGE`

Be patient and let it attack first. Stay on any of its sides to make it turn to your direction when it's ready to attack, then dodge that attack and go for its weak point.

Against the tiny spiders, charge your ▢ and do Soul Spin to make an even stronger one that'll attract much more spiders, dealing the most amount of damage.

At half health, the Mega Spider will shoot 3 web projectiles. Wait them out before taking action.

My Whip Will Slice You! [10]
Defeat Dr. Finkelstein without taking damage on Nightmare Mode
```
`CHALLENGE`

Going for the "faster method" is rather risky, considering how easy it is to be hit by the guns or the blades if you're not careful. If you're not confident with this, it is safer to complete the dances due to you being positioned right in front of him after the dance.

You can avoid the Guns by getting far away from the direction they're initially pointing. You'll have enough time to destroy one of them this way. Don't go for the other guns right after if you don't want to be immediately blasted.

Wether you just want to wait for the dance part or not, grabbing his head and trying to open it will also make notes appear. It is best to go for it when his inventions are not opperational.

You Faced My Rage [25]
Defeat Lock, Shock and Barrel without taking damage on Nightmare Mode
```
`CHALLENGE`

Use Blue Souls, and throw the traps back at them in the first phase to make it as short as possible. Beware that the kids can throw 2 traps at the same time usually.

For the second phase to go smoothly, you need to make sure to destroy the bathtub while it's correctly positioned close to the edges of the arena (preferably either up or down side for better camera position). When all three get off the bathtub, change immediately to the Pumpkin King Costume and constantly blast them with Fire Blast while making sure to hit all three of them. All 3 will get knocked up in the air and take a very high amount of damage. Then Fire Blast as soon as they get up from the ground to hit them again.

If something went wrong and you could only get 2 or 1 of them, try to lure them to one another and Fire Blast them, but be weary of whoever is free.

I'm the Only Pumpkin King! [25]
Defeat Oogie Boogie without taking damage on Nightmare Mode
```
`CHALLENGE`

The tactic is almost the same as the normal one. Destroy one of the cards as quickly as possible while standing close to the central platform. Then move a bit into the free space created before getting hit by the central platform.

Don't try to hit the gunners. They are very annoying due to becoming targetable at the same time as they start shooting. You could time a Fire Blast (△) exactly at the moment where they become vulnerable, which is when Oogie says "Joking!" for the second time, but it's much better to just stay away from them. They won't contribute much damage either way.

When you need to throw the exploding dices in his mouth, you have time to throw 2 at him. They won't do extra damage, but it gives you more space to not get hit by the explosions.

Half-Cold Half-Hot [10]
Defeat the Fire King and Ice King without taking damage on Nightmare Mode
```
`CHALLENGE`

Fire Blast (△) is effective against the Ice King Skeleton, while the Fire King Skeleton will absorb its damage. That however causes it to standing still to absorb the Fire Blast making it safe to defeat Ice King Skeleton right away.

Fire King Skeleton can only be defeated normally by hitting him behind. Be careful when getting behind it, and use a Blue Soul to finish it off quickly.

A Filthy Finale [25]
Defeat Mega Oogie 1st Phase without taking damage on Nightmare Mode
```
`COMPLETION` `CHALLENGE`

Don't try to hit his feet. It makes you an easy target to his attacks. You're better off standing in the upper part of the arena.

If you feel like you can't dodge an attack, you can fall down or get in the upper part based on where you're to make his attacks stop while he's executing them.

Remember the invincibility extension with the dodge, as it'll be useful to dodge all of his attacks. There's also a bit of invincibility from the tiny jump before the explosion of the Fire Blast that you can use to dodge the slap attack. Though it does require not only a strict timing, but also Red Souls that could be used for more constant damage with the gas leaks (not an issue if you have infinite Red Souls).

`COMPLETION` `CHALLENGE`

This dance also has that same sequence as the earlier Oogie Boogie boss fight, but in here it is way harder than that. More specifically, the last 2 parts of the dance can caught you off guard if you're not ready.

Smokin' Sexy Style!! [5]
Get a Pumpkin King Combo Rank for the first time [Dances don't count]
```

Perform a total combo of 150 without breaking it to reach **Pumpkin King** combo rank.

You'll have many opportunities to do this, but the easiest to do this is in Chapter 3. Continue until you're trapped in an arena fight with Shock. Perform Soul Cycle (△ Charged), and keep it going using Blue Souls before the Soul Robber becomes red (sometimes the enemies drop a Blue Soul too). When you run out of Blue Souls, keep the combo going by either hitting the enemies with a normal attack or with Soul Spin (↻ Left Stick, ▢).

Defeat Mega Oogie 1st Phase without using the Pumpkin King Costume
```
`COMPLETION` `CHALLENGE`

This is an endurance test: you'll lose so much damage by not being able to light the gas leaks, so you'll have to rely entirely on Soul Robber and your ability to survive against all of his attacks. Remember the tips presented in You're King Of Nothing!, and to use your Crystal Bottles

The Speedrun Before Christmas [50]
Beat the game in 3 hours or less [New File, Save File Timer, Any Difficulty]
```
`COMPLETION` `CHALLENGE`

It is suggested to do this after at least beating the game once to have an understand of what to do throughout the game. To give an idea, if you do S rank in time on each chapter or better, then you should be close to the required time for this achievement

**Tips**
* Easy Mode is suggested to make the enemies and bosses much easier to defeat.
* The cutscenes and the pause menu won't freeze the timer. While the ranking screen or the level select screen won't move the timer.
* You can save when finishing a chapter in case you want to retry the next chapter for a better time.
* You're not obbligated to fight most of the enemies in the game. Some are obbligatory to progress, but most of them are not necessary.
* The only upgrades that you'll ever need to buy are the Soul Robber's. Pumpkin King Costume upgrades can be considered to be safe.
* For the Golden Pumpkins, some can be gotten while progressing through the chapter, while the ones in the shop or the Hidden Places will waste time.

**Chapter 1**

[![Speedrun Chapter 1](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/assets/133049176/09940d08-aa91-4b44-8d39-d6d3d81a1c90)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEQ3aKmckXk)

Fight the skeletons until Oogie Boogie starts to talk. It'll take you 6 skeletons.

The skeletons will continue to spawn endlessly until Oogie Boogie stops talking. Finish them off when he starts laughing.

Move immediately in the Town Hall to start the boss fight.

Hitting Shadow Oogie does lead to constant damage, but while hitting him, grab some notes so that you'll finish him off fast.

***

**Chapter 2**

Talk to Corpse Kid. Then move to the Witches' Shop, ignoring the enemies.

It's unlikely that you'll have anything to buy, so after the cutscene, immediately exit. Talk to Corpse Kid again and enter into the manhole.

Defeat all the enemies in here and talk to the Clown.

Get out of the manhole and go to the entrance of Halloween Town, where you started on chapter 1, and defeat the enemies that'll appear. Then interact with the gate.

***

**Chapter 3**

Go past all the enemies and reach the big dead tree by following the way to the left and talk to Hanging Tree. You can waste a bit of time getting to the golden pumpkin on the tree.

Then go back to where you entered this area to initiate a fight with Lock. Defeat all the enemies (square combo is better), then interact with the dog house of Zero, next to the entrance to Halloween Town.

Find the 5 Hang Men throughout the area. After getting to the last Hang Men on top of the tree, talk to the Hanging Tree.
