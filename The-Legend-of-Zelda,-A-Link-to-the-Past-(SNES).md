# 2) Introduction

The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past is an action-adventure game developed and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the third game in The Legend of Zelda series and was released in 1991 in Japan and 1992 in North America and Europe.

A Link to the Past focuses on Link as he journeys to save Hyrule, defeat the dark lord Ganon, and rescue the descendants of the Seven Sages. It returns to a top-down perspective similar to the original The Legend of Zelda, dropping the side-scrolling gameplay of Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. It introduced series staples such as parallel worlds and items including the Master Sword. 

A Link to the Past has a total of 55 Achievements worth 435 points. The achievement set has been created by Retro Achievement developers [dude1286](https://retroachievements.org/User/dude1286), [HenrySwanson](https://retroachievements.org/User/HenrySwanson) and [AntTanGames](https://retroachievements.org/User/AntTanGames). The set of achievements are mostly designed to be achievable by the casual player, with the no-damage achievements for the more hardcore players. The game also has multiple leaderboards, including minigames and no-hit runs.

# 3) Walkthrough

[**Step 1: Story Achievements**](#step-1-story-achievements--total-points-137)

All of the story achievements are not missable, and will come to you over time when beating the game. The guide has sorted them on the chronological order of getting them in-game.

[**Step 2: Collecting Achievements (1 missable)**](#step-2-collecting-achievements-1-missable--total-points-163)

This step will lead you through finding every item, upgrades, and every chest in the dungeons and overworld. Every item achievement will also list what the requirements are that you need before you can go out to hunt them, sorted chronologically as much as possible.

This step has one missable achievement:

* [Magical Shield (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/2294) - The Magical Shield needs to be upgraded in the waterfall next to Zora's domain rather than be bought in one of the shops in the Dark World.

[**Step 3: Boss Achievements (11 missable)**](#step-3-boss-achievements-11-missable--total-points-135)

There are multiple achievements per boss that you fight in this game. Note that once you beat a boss, it will be gone forever and cannot be fought again, therefore making all of these achievements missable. It is recommended to copy your save file to the other in-game save slots before finishing a dungeon in case you need multiple attempts.

# 4) Tips and tricks (no spoilers)

* Remember that the game has a built-in copy feature for save files, for a maximum of 3 slots. This can be especially useful if you want to keep a boss for later due to it being too tough, or if you want to do dungeons in a specific order as you can (kinda) do the Dark World dungeons in a different order than stated.
* * One such example is by getting the item from the dungeon, but not beating the boss yet. This way, you can keep the boss from the first dungeon in the Dark World alive and kill him last for example.
* By visiting the ice cave in the lower-right part of the Light World and charging into the fairy statue in the middle, a bee will fly out. This bee is special as it stays alive for longer, and will attack enemies for you when you store it in a bottle. This also works on bosses, and can in some situations be very effective.
* After beating the second dungeon in the Dark World, I recommend getting the item from the fourth dungeon in Thieves Town first. That way, you can lift up heavier stones and get a lot of items that will make parts of the game and no-damage bosses easier. For example, you can get your sword tempered and obtain the Magic Cape from the cemetery, which makes you invincible at the cost of magic points. Do keep in mind that both the Magic Cape and Cane of Byrna are NOT allowed for no-damage bosses.
* When taking damage from a boss, your best option is to use the magic mirror to teleport back to the entrance. Resetting the game will place you at a specific spot on the map, so you'd have to walk all the way back to the dungeon.

## Step 3: Boss achievements (11 missable) | **Total points: 135**

![](https://retroachievements.org/Badge/347420.png) [Toying with the Red Knight (5)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/314001)   
_Kill the Red Armos Knight of the Eastern Palace using only the boomerang and collect the Pendant of Courage._

-=MISSABLE=-

Kill five of the six Armos Knights with arrows. You should be able to do this damageless by remaining in the south-east or south-west corner and just keep shooting. When the final one becomes red, damage it only with your boomerang to kill it. Keep your distance at all times and play it safe, only using the boomerang when he does his stomp attack, as the boomerang does very little damage so you will be here for the long run.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/129287.png) [Bested Armos Knights (10)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/2285)   
_Defeat all the Armos Knights without being harmed._

-=MISSABLE=-

**Recommendations: None. They can be harmed with a sword, but the arrows are definitely the better option here.**

The Armos Knights most likely won't give you too much trouble. Just stay in one corner (I prefer south-east) and keep shooting arrows till only one Armos Knight remains. Every Armos Knight dies within 3 arrows, so use that to your advantage. The final Armos Knight will jump around and try to hit you from above, but this shouldn't be too much trouble if you keep walking around away from his landing position.

***

![](https://retroachievements.org/Badge/347421.png) [Worm Kebabs (10)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/314001)   
_Kill the Lanmolas of the Desert Palace dealing all damage with arrows, then collect the Pendant of Power._

-=MISSABLE=-

It takes four arrows to kill each Lanmolas, meaning that you need at the very least 12 arrows to subdue them all. It's important in this boss fight to keep your distance and aim correctly, as you can only shoot one arrow at a time. Trying to shoot 3 arrows through every Lanmolas and then finishing them off one by one may be a preferred method due to the final one spitting out eight rocks when resurfacing rather than four.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/129288.png) [Bested Lanmolas (10)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/2289)   
_Defeat all three Lanmolas without being harmed._

-=MISSABLE=-

**Recommendations: Ice Rod.**

Surprisingly one of the tougher bosses to no-damage since there isn't really an easy strategy, and I unfortunately don't have a lot of advice to give here either. The Ice Rod is a recommendation, but it won't necessarily save you--it will just do a bit more damage than your sword. The best advice I can give is to wait for the final Lanmolas to pop out and try to hit that one. The rocks they shoot out always go diagonally so take your time and be extra careful. Do keep in kind however, that the final undefeated Lanmolas will shoot out in eight directions. I definitely recommend keeping the Ice Rod for the final one to get rid of it easier. Patience really is key here, and should be your main priority.

***

![](https://retroachievements.org/Badge/347422.png) [Gone is 20 Seconds (10)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/314003)   
_Defeat Moldorm in Hera's Tower within 20 seconds._

-=MISSABLE=-

This is relatively tough and not advised to combine with the no-damage achievement, as you have practically no time to miss attacks and play it safe. There will be a trigger available at all time to let you know whether the 20 seconds has passed or not, so use that to your advantage--if it's not there, drop down and retry. My recommended approach is that after the first hit, stand right behind Moldorm and unsheathe your sword and follow where it goes, which should guarantee another quick hit. Using the Pegasus Boots is also a recommended approach during his last phase when he starts moving faster.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/129289.png) [Bested Moldorm (10)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/2314)   
_Defeat Moldorm without being harmed._

-=MISSABLE=-

**Recommendations: None**

I unfortunately don't have much advice for Moldorm. The good thing about him is that he can't hurt you as long as you are charging your sword. The problem here isn't taking damage however, but falling down. Fortunately, falling down also means an easy reset, so you can try this boss over and over again. He definitely is an annoying boss, but he shouldn't really hurt you, so the achievement should be pretty easy to unlock. If the boss still gives you trouble, you can try pause buffering him by constantly opening and closing the menu until he is in a good position to strike.

***

![](https://retroachievements.org/Badge/347423.png) [You Really Bug Me Out (5)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/314004)   
_Defeat Agahnim in Hyrule Castle Tower without unsheathing your sword._

-=MISSABLE=-

As the achievement icon and title hint at, you can only use the Bug Catching Net to reflect Agahnim's hits. Since the damage returned is always the same, this boss battle follows the exact same pattern as described in the no-damage achievement, and can very well be combined together.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/129290.png) [Bested Agahnim (10)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/2337)   
_Defeat Agahnim in Hyrule Castle without being harmed._

-=MISSABLE=-

**Recommendations: None.**

The worst part about Agahnim? Having to go through that entire dungeon again if you mess up. Joking aside, Agahnim isn't too bad of a boss. He has three different attacks, of which one is very easily predictable- and avoidable. Whenever he goes to the most northern-middle spot and does not follow you around the room, he will use a lightning attack that can be avoided by going to the left or right wall. The other two aren't as easily identifiable, but shouldn't pose too much trouble either. The red shot can be reflected with the sword (or bug net) right at Agahnim, and it's recommended to stand straight across him to make sure it hits. The other attack is a bit trickier, as it is a blue circle that goes into 6 directions upon hitting a sword or a wall. You can hit it and hope the shield protects you if one of the directions is towards you, but I personally found that to be a bit too RNG-heavy for my liking. Avoiding the blue circle is definitely my preferred option. Keep this up for a bit and Agahnim is down.

***

![](https://retroachievements.org/Badge/347424.png) [Mallet and Skewer (10)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/314005)   
_Crack the Helmasaur's face Shield using only the hammer, then deal the rest of the damage with a silver arrow._

-=MISSABLE=-

Due to the necessity of the silver arrows, this achievement can no be attempted before having beaten the Ice Palace and Misery Mire, so get the hammer and leave the dungeon for later. You'll first have to deal with his face shield, which takes a total of 16 hammer hits. Once that is down, shoot one silver arrow and it's dead. Due to the first phase being more predictable/easier to avoid attacks due to him moving around slower, it may be favourable combining this achievement with the no-damage achievement.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/129291.png) [Bested Helmasaur King (10)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/2352)   
_Defeat Helmasaur King without being harmed._

-=MISSABLE=-

**Recommendations: Bombs. If you're keeping this boss for later, you can also bring an Upgraded Sword or the Light Arrows**

The Helmasaur King is an interesting boss: he's not too difficult, but you have to be careful at all times. I recommend getting rid of the shield by dropping/throwing bombs (I prefer the former), as his movements are pretty predictable. It only takes 4 bombs to get rid of the shield, while it takes 16 hammer hits. The Helmasaur King only has two attacks to worry about: the first is where he spits out a fireball, that turns into three fireballs that implode diagonally. For this attack, it's best to go to the wall that's farthest away so you can easily dodge them. The other is his tail attack, indicated by when the tail starts moving faster. This is actually easily avoidable by standing directly in front of him. The only thing you need to be careful about here, especially in his second phase, is that he starts moving again right after the tail attack ends. If he runs into you, that obviously counts as damage. You can also avoid this by going to the wall that's farthest away, but I find standing in front of him easier.

***

![](https://retroachievements.org/Badge/347425.png) [I Only Have Ice For You (5)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/314006)   
_Defeat Arrghus's final phase dealing damage only with the Ice Rod then rescue the maiden._

-=MISSABLE=-

Defeat the first phase as you would do normally: stand on either the left- or right side of Arrghus, hookshot his puffs and slash at them. Once all are gone, he will jump and move around the room diagonally. Use the Ice Rod to deal damage four times, and the boss fight is over. This achievement can very well be combined with the no-damage achievement and shouldn't pose too much trouble.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/129292.png) [Bested Arrghus (10)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/2356)   
_Defeat Arrghus without being harmed._

-=MISSABLE=-

**Recommendations: None**

Arrghus is a really easy boss, but you still have to be careful. ONLY Hookshot the minions off of him from the left- or right side, as doing it from above or below him has the chance for the minions to go too far into your sprite, damaging you when they're travelling back. When he does his swirl attack, go to the exact opposite of the room as he can't reach you. When all of the minions are gone, charge up your sword and keep walking around to make sure he doesn't land on you. Arrghus only moves diagonally, so that should make his movements predictable. 4 charged sword attacks should end him for good.

***

![](https://retroachievements.org/Badge/347426.png) [Oprah's Dramatic Gift Reveal (10)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/314007)   
_Finish off Mothula with bees and then rescue the maiden._

-=MISSABLE=-

It is recommended to keep this boss until you have obtained the Tempered Sword (not Golden Sword), but you can also do it with the Fire Rod. Hit it about three times with the tempered sword or five times with the Fire Rod, then let the Good Bee do the remainder of the work.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/129293.png) [Bested Mothula (10)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/2358)   
_Defeat Mothula without being harmed._

-=MISSABLE=-

**Recommendations: Good Bee, Tempered Sword (NOT THE GOLDEN SWORD, THIS IS BUGGED).**

Mothula is a tough boss, so it is recommended to use both your sword- and Fire Rod and alternate between the two depending on how safe you have you play it. Mothula uses his beam attack every two-three seconds, so the only time you should go in for a sword attack is right after the attack happened. After the sword attack, keep your distance and use the Fire Rod until he repeats the pattern. Remaining near the middle of the screen is always favourable due to the spikes from the sides moving slowly towards the opposite side of the screen. They do a little nudge before moving, so pause buffering may be something to consider if the boss gives you too much trouble.

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/129294.png) [Bested Blind (10)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/2360)   
_Defeat Blind without being harmed._

-=MISSABLE=-

**Recommendations: Magic Cape, Good Bee, 1-2 Magic Potions, Tempered Sword (or Golden Sword if you're killing Blind after the 5th and 6th dungeon).**

The easiest way to get rid of Blind is by releasing the Good Bee and then going invincible with the Magic Cape while attacking with your sword. Keep good track of your magic meter and if necessary, drink a magic potion only when you are truly safe to do so as you won't be invincible during that time. Be extra careful with re-appearing as both the heads and their lasers will damage you.

_Defeat Kholdstare without being harmed._

-=MISSABLE=-

**Recommendations: Bombos Medallion, Fire Rod and/or Magic Cape, 1-2 Magic Potions**

Upon entrance, use the Bombos Medallion immediately to get rid of Kholdstare's ice armour. From there, it really is up to you on how you want to beat him as Kholdstare isn't too difficult--you just need to beware of the falling snow. You can use the Fire Rod to do massive damage, or take it the safe way and just go invincible with the Magic Cape and then keep slashing with the sword.

***

_Defeat Vitreous without being harmed._

-=MISSABLE=-

**Recommendations: Magic Cape, 1-2 magic potions, Arrows**

Magic Cape is your best friend for the first phase as you can just stand in front of Vitreous and keep slashing and the eyes that keep popping out. When he only has 4 eyes left, the big eye itself will pop out. Just stand in front of the door and keep shooting at him with arrows as he won't try to do anything except getting close to you.

_Defeat Trinexx without being harmed._

-=MISSABLE=-

**Recommendations: Golden Sword, Magic Cape, 1-2 Magic Potions, Fire and Ice rod**

This boss might look menacing, but it's not that bad. What you want to do first is getting rid of the ice head on the right. The head movements may be confusing at first, but if you have the Golden Sword you only need to hit it 3 times. You can hit 2 times per stun with the rod. If you do this flawlessly, you should be able to kill it before the main body attacks but if not, just back off for a bit as his only attack is very predictable: the head will lunge at you when the tail starts moving faster. This attack won't hit you if you keep walking in a straight line. After taking care of the ice head, repeat the same for the fire head. Once those are down, use the Magic Cape to go invincible and you've won.

_Defeat Ganon without being harmed._

**Recommendations: Golden Sword, 1 Full Heal Potion, 2-3 Magic Potions, Magic Cape**

Ganon's fight has 4 "phases", but the first 3 are pretty much insignificant as you can take care of all of them by just going invincible and slashing at him. You'll need to drink a magic potion on his 3rd phase, but that should pose no problem as a lot of his time is spent just teleporting around. The 4th phase is where it can get slightly tricky, and where you also need to be cautious. You need to light two beacons while Ganon is shooting a fire bat at you, so make sure to light them fast with the Fire Rod. When he's visible again, ONLY attack him when you know
where exactly he will appear, and if you can hit him the moment he appears. If you're even a second late, he'll fire his bat at you which is hard to avoid when you're close to him. Hit him so he's stunned, fire a silver arrow at him and repeat this 4 times. Take your time for the final phase and you'll be just fine. If you do take damage, reset the game and drink a full heal potion as your health/magic bar won't be full upon restart to ensure you can try it again very easily.
