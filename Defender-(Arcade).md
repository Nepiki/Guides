## About the Author

Hi! I'm Wes, the author of the RetroAchievements set for Defender. My fascination with this iconic game began in my childhood, when my father purchased a well-maintained arcade cabinet from a local dentist. He'd play Defender to unwind after a long day at work, and together, we'd spend hours enjoying the game to the tunes of classic 80s hits. We kept things engaging by creating various challenges, like seeing who could survive on one life through an entire song or limiting ourselves to only 5 lives and 5 smart bombs.

As time went on, our skills and scores improved, and during my college years, I finally surpassed the million-point mark. This achievement sparked my interest in competitive arcade gaming, leading me to participate in [Donkey Kong high score competitions](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/05/is-this-the-worlds-first-perfect-game-of-donkey-kong/). Although I'm grateful for my experiences with Donkey Kong, Defender will always hold a special place in my heart. I hope you find this guide helpful and that it ignites the same passion for this classic game in you.
