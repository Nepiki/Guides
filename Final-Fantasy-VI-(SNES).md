# 2) Introduction

Often listed as one of the greatest RPGs of all time, Final Fantasy 6 is the story of a young girl born with magical abilities in a world where magic was destroyed long ago.  The game boasts an impressive cast, quick combat and excellent music.  The set was primarily created by [cirellio](https://retroachievements.org/user/cirellio) with additional achievements by [televandalist](https://retroachievements.org/user/televandalist). Many of the achievements in the set are showcases of easter eggs or unique dialog, making a large portion of them missable during a normal playthrough. This guide will tackle the achievements in chronological order to get the most out of your playthrough.

# 3) Walkthrough

## Before you Begin

Several achievements that require specific actions, such as not opening a chest or purchasing an item, but the achievement does not unlock until additional actions are taken much later in the game.  These are noted with ðŸš© in the guide, but here is a summary:
* ðŸš© Do not open any chests in South Figaro Cave in the World of Balance. ðŸš©
* ðŸš© During Terra's Scenario, do not open the chest containing Rune Edge in the Narshe Caves. ðŸš©
* ðŸš© Do not purchase both Magicite in the Jidoor Auction House until you win the Zephyr Cloak in the World of Ruin. ðŸš©

Two achievements are mutually exclusive depending on choices made.  Most of these occur late in the game, so creating a separate save file at the split is recommended.  
* [Beyond the Shadows I (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/5653) and [Beyond the Shadows II (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/5132)  
Create a separate save on the Floating Continent.  
* [Illuminated! (4)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/7299) and [Life, Crystalized (25)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/6618)  
Create a separate save before choosing which form Ragnarok should take in Narshe (WoR).

[LLG (50)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/7296)**  
_Clear the game with no character exceeding level 30_

While doing a single playthrough is possible for this set, many people will prefer to do this achievement on a 2nd playthrough.  That said, most LLG guides for Final Fantasy 6 aim for level 10 or lower, so this is quite lenient compared to what is possible.  Here are some tips that can help:
* Run away from as many battles as you can and aim to leave the WoB with no character level 25 or higher.  
* Put all characters in the back row to reduce damage while running away.  
* The evade stat is bugged and uses the magic evade value instead. For example, Priest's Miter gives +10% to both Magic and Physical Evasion instead of only Magic.  
* Obtain the Genji Glove by rejecting Banon's offer 3 times.  Buy two Morning Stars and equip them on Locke for big damage.

[Beastlord (25)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/5432) & Others**  
Mastery requires learning all of Gau's Rage abilities from the Veldt.  In order for monsters to appear on the Veldt, they must first be encountered in the world.  Each section will begin with a list of the monsters you can encounter and marked with a ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120497130/223925308-05cdd86e-eb5b-4f21-9c0c-60e07e2f55ef.png).  Ensure that you run into at least 1 formation so that you can collect their rage on the Veldt later in the game.  For Low Level playthroughs, you can simply run away from the battle and it will still count.  Check the entries in the main guide for additional tips to optimize this process.

_Watch the snowfield scene without skipping_

When starting the game, watch the entire opening credits without skipping.

_I guess default's not good enough for you_

Open the menu and go to Config.  Scroll down to the bottom and change the RGB window color settings.

_Destroy Whelk's armored shell_

Whelk is the first boss of the game.  The shell has 50000 HP, whereas the boss has 1600.  Attacking the shell will make it counter with a party-wide attack, but it only has enough MP to do this 6 times.  Heal between attacks until it runs out of MP, then you are mostly safe.  Keep an eye on your HP, while hitting the shell with Tek-Missle and Beams.  You'll need roughly 80 rounds to finish it.

_Steal a MithrilKnife while protecting Terra in the Caves of Narshe_

While defending Terra with the Moogles, use Locke to steal from the boss until you unlock the achievement.  If Locke's party dies, you can finish the boss with one of the other parties.

_Equip Sprint Shoes on any character_

These are available at many Relic stores.  The earliest can be obtained in South Figaro.

An elixir is hidden in a secret passage behind the large mansion in the top left corner of town.  Locke will run through this room later during his scenario.

_Perform AuraBolt_

To perform AuraBolt, input `Down > Down/Left > Left` during Blitz input.  On the SNES, `Down > Down > Left` will also work.  This can be done as early as the Vargas fight when you first obtain Sabin.

### Returner Hideout
**![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120497130/223468739-769084ea-9899-4985-a08a-6aba6ddafa5e.png) [Stubborn Girl (2)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/5128)**  
_Refuse Banon's offer three times_

Answer "No" to Bannon's request 3 times.  After each refusal, you will be sent back inside to the hideout.  Simply go back out again.

### Lete River

_Spending TOO MUCH TIME on the Lete River_

Immediately after the save point in the middle of Lete River, select `Up` at the next branch.  This will send you back to the same branch.  Repeat this several times to unlock this achievement.  Note: This is an easy way to level up characters early on, however, you will miss out on stat bonuses granted by Espers upon leveling up, since you have non-equipped at this time.

_Turn up the heat on your first encounter with Ultros_

Use Terra to cast fire on Ultros when you run into him after the 2nd save point.

### Locke's Scenario
**The split scenarios can be done in any order, but consider saving Sabin for last so that you can acquire rages in the other scenarios before your first trip to the Veldt.**

_Negotiate Locke's scenario without stealing any clothes (no guard clipping)_

In order to earn this achievement, do not attempt to steal from any merchants or soldiers.  First, turn your Battle Speed to its slowest (6) in Config.  This will allow you to get two hits on the HeavyArmor in between each of hit rounds.  Equip the Genji Gloves that you earned from rejecting Banon and your best 2 weapons.  Attack the heavy armor located to the left of where you started.  The timing is tight, but you should be able to kill him before he kills you.  Consider using a potion if you get low on health.  After killing him, take a hidden passage behind the building and across the river right behind the enemy.  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120497130/223565263-56160570-493a-4244-b193-252e7159c8f7.png)  
Head into the cafe and go down the stairs next to the bartender.  Kill (don't steal!) the merchant to take his cider.
Return to the same HeavyArmor and beat him again.  Climb the stairs and offer the cider to the Old Man.  Go down the stairs and give the kid the password: "Courage".  Find the main bedroom in the mansion and go behind the bookcase.  The achievement will unlock before you reach Celes' cell.

ðŸš© **Again, do not open any chests in South Figaro Cave.** ðŸš©  
One of these chests needs to be opened in the WoR in order to earn [Patience Pays II (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/6400)

_Steal Air Lancet from TunnelArmr, never use Runic, and win in Locke's scenario_

Locke should still be equipped with Genji Gloves and his best weapons.  Heal up using the fountain just before the boss fight.  Make sure you successfully steal the Air Lancet, and then have Locke attack while Celes heals with cure/items.

### Terra's Scenario

_Make Banon ride a chocobo_

Before entering Narshe, take the party south and slightly west of where Figaro Castle was.  Enter the forest and look for a Chocobo hut.  Change Banon to the party leader and hire a chocobo.  Enjoy the bizarre show.

ðŸš© **Do not open the chest containing Rune Edge in the Narshe Caves.** ðŸš©  
This chest needs to be opened in the WoR to earn [Kuku's Treasures (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/5818).

### Sabin's Scenario

_Have two Ghosts in your party at once_

Unlocking this achievement requires two party slots for ghosts, which means that Shadow must leave the party if you recruited him.  After the Imperial Base, he has a 1/16 chance to leave after winning a battle.  Once you board the train, he will no longer leave until after the train sequence.  Simply fight enemies until he leaves.  Once you board the train, talk to a ghost to recruit them to your party, leave the room, and come back again to recruit another.

_Learn the Tier 1 Rages_

If you have encountered all the enemies in the Rage checklist so far, this achievement can be earned on your first trip to the Vedlt.  This could be recommended for LLG runs as Gau's Rages are some of the best abilities to use against bosses.  Remember that Gau will learn Rages from both the encounter he leapt on and the encounter he returned on.  If you accidently hit Gau, he will not learn the rages from that encounter.
