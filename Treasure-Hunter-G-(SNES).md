# Introduction

Treasure Hunter G is a JRPG that was released in 1996. It was never exported outside of Japan. A fan translation was done in 2002 and is the one still used today. The four main characters of the game were later used as main characters in Saga Frontier for the PS1, though with different roles. The game was released two weeks before Square announced that it would cease to develop games for Nintendo consoles. It would be another eight years before Square would develop for a Nintendo console again.

# Road Map

The game can be done in a single play through but there are plenty of missable achievements along the way. Once you leave an island, you can't return to it, so you need to make sure you have everything you need before you leave. It'll be mostly obvious when you'll be leaving an island to go to the next.

A lot of the achievements are standard progression, and can't be missed, but they'll still be included in the road map below so you know what to expect and when. There isn't much in the way of guides on the internet, especially not for 100%, but I've made maps to help. All achievements should be listed in the order they can be first obtained.
