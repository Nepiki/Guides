# 1) Introduction

Welcome to the Shadow Hearts Missable Guide!

Number of missable achievements: 25

This set has 160 achievements of which only 25 are missable. That is a pretty good rate for a big JRPG.

First read the first post in the forum https://retroachievements.org/viewtopic.php?t=18268 so you understand you need to play this on a fresh new game (Not NG+)

The game is basically split in two parts. The first half takes place in Asia while the second part and the endgame takes place in Europe. 

Most Missables are encountered in the first half because the story and area progression is very linear and you won't be able to return to earlier areas. So make sure to save in the beginning of every new area you arrive in.
The second half lets you travel around the world more freely and visit earlier areas, BUT there is some missable endgame sidequest content. So make sure to save before entering the last dungeon.

Secondly: Be aware of missable monsters for the library achievement

Talk to Joshua (The boy who stole your wallet) when you are in the hideout in London so you don't miss this. He will take Halley's normal Slingshot and give it back to you later, improved!

Hint: Find the couple in the inn in Rouen
