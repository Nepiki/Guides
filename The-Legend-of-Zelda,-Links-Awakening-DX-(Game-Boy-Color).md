Hello there, I'm Nepiki! I'm a gamer who has an unofficial case of amnesia so I have an obsession with writing everything down so I don't forget about it! Joking aside, I do genuinely like writing, especially if it helps out other people. I don't have a lot of guides yet, but expect to see more pop up in the future!

For everything me related, here are some links you can check out:

ALL OF THESE ACHIEVEMENTS ARE MISSABLE.

This is an almost complete step-by-step walkthrough for the game, sorted chronologically and split up in "chapters". This covers a lot of achievements and is made to ensure that you will only have to do one playthrough without missing anything. Please also refer to section 4 for important notes, as you have to make progress on some missable achievements throughout the entire game.

## Step 3: Missable Achievements | **Total points: 60**

### Achievements with missables throughout the entire game (read before continuing)

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/90713.png) [A Dream Come True [m] (50)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/28828)   
_Help Marin fulfill her dream_

-=MISSABLE=-

This achievement is earned after beating the final boss and watching the ending. The goal is pretty simple: don't die. Ever. This achievement can only be obtained while the file select screen shows 000 under your name. While this might sound difficult, it's very doable in my opinion. Save often by pressing start, select, A and B all at the same time, and whenever you die, just reset the game. I recommend saving at the start of every dungeon anyway for the hitless boss achievements.

Additionally, I recommend going for the Color Dungeon A.S.A.P., which is available after the second dungeon. Go for the Blue Tunic to reduce damage taken, which is far more important than increasing damage dealt. You can hold one of Tracy's potions at a time (bought from the store south of the cave where BowWow was held captive) that revive you and refill all your hearts on losing all your hearts. Finally, I recommend getting the Boomerang after the sixth dungeon because it is a very overpowered weapon in this game that kills most enemies in one hit.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/90733.png) [The Travels of THIEF [m] (25)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/31930)   
_Complete the Photo Album_

-=MISSABLE=-

You need to get a total of 12 pictures to complete the photo album. After clearing the first dungeon, immediately talk to the camera mouse in his house east of the cave where BowWow is held captive so that he will always appear when needed. Be sure to save before talking to the mouse, as there is an achievement for accepting his offer to photograph you, and rejecting him. Reload the save file after getting either.

Four of these are completely missable, which are:

1) Between Dungeon 2 and Dungeon 3, after talking to Richard who sends you to his castle, go stand in front of the bridge of the castle.
2) Between Dungeon 3 and Dungeon 4, Marin will be accompanying you. See achievement "Date Night - A Walk on the Beach [m]" for the requirements.
3) Between Dungeon 3 and Dungeon 4, Marin will be accompanying you. See achievement "Date Night - All is Not Well [m]" for the requirements.
4) Between Dungeon 3 and Dungeon 4, Marin will be accompanying you. See achievement "Date Night - An Afternoon at the Windmill [m]" for the requirements.

The remainder of the pictures can be done at any time.

5) Obtained after talking to the camera man.
6) Peek over the window of Old Man Ulrira's House, south of Marin and Tarin's house in Mabe Village.
7) Aproach BowWow in Mabe Village.
8) After the fishermen under the bridge has fished up something, return to him later and talk to him while the photographer is swimming there. Requires the Flippers.
9) After obtaining the magnifying lens from the "Magnifying Lens" achievement, go to the north-east house in the animal village. 
10) Approach the grave where you take the ghost to who follows you during the "A Ghostly Escort" achievement.
11) Cross a bridge in Tal Tal Heights and the photographer will appear. I'm not sure if every bridge works, but I got it on the far east bridge next to the rooster house.
12) Steal something from the shop by walking around the shopkeeper and while he looks to the wall, exit the shop. The photographer doesn't appear during this action. ONLY STEAL SOMETHING AFTER YOU BOUGHT AT LEAST THE SHOVEL, BOMBS, AND BOW OR YOU'LL RUIN THE PLAYTHROUGH!!!

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/90732.png) [Shell Collection [m] (25)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/28849)   
_Collect all possible 26 Secret Seashells across Koholint_

-=MISSABLE=-

This achievement can be very nasty so proceed with extra caution. Do NOT get the L-2 Sword after obtaining 20, because it will make the remaining seashells disappear from your save file. Wait until you got all 26.

Pay extra attention to the following 3 completely missable seashells:

1) Go to the Seashell Mansion immediately when getting 5 seashells to get a sixth. This won't work if you have more than 5 seashells.
2) Go to the Seashell Mansion immediately when getting 10 seashells to get an elevent. This won't work if you have more than 10 seashells.
3) After reviving the flying rooster, go to the cave south of Richard's Castle with the cave behind 5 bottomless pits. You can only (legitimately) cross these pits with the rooster. The rooster will disappear after clearing dungeon 7 and cannot be regained.

For the remainder of the seashells, please refer to [This Zeldadungeon Guide](https://www.zeldadungeon.net/wiki/Link%27s_Awakening_Secret_Seashells_(Game_Boy)).

### Buying achievements (do these before you can steal)

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/223970.png) [Buying Bombs [m] (1)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/201702)   
_Purchase bombs (Can't steal them or already be labeled a THIEF)_

-=MISSABLE=-

Available in the shop after clearing the first dungeon, and costs only 10 rupees.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/223969.png) [Buying the Shovel [m] (5)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/201701)   
_Purchase a shovel (Can't steal them or already be labeled a THIEF)_

-=MISSABLE=-

Available in the shop right from the start, and costs 200 rupees.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/224006.png) [Buying the Bow [m] (1)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/201738)   
_Purchase the Bow (Can't steal them or already be labeled a THIEF)_

-=MISSABLE=-

Available in the shop after buying the shovel, and costs 980 rupees. This is a huge amount, but I do recommend getting it as fast as possible because it will make a lot of achievements easier. Absolutely get this before the fifth dungeon because you need it there for achievements.

***

### Achievement only available before clearing the first dungeon

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/223980.png) [The Shroomless Raccoon [m] (5)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/201712)   
_Without ever entering the screen with the mushroom, use Magic Powder on the raccoon in the Mysterious Forest._

-=MISSABLE=-

***

### Achievements only available before clearing the second dungeon

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/223967.png) [Tail Cave Cartographer [m] (10)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/201699)   
_Enter every room in Tail Cave (Last room must be the shell room, open chest to Trigger)._

-=MISSABLE=-

There is one room in this dungeon that needs to be opened with the bombs, which should be unavailable before beating the first dungeon under normal circumstances. Make sure you have the entire dungeon chartered out (press start if you found the map), then go to this room and open the chest for the achievement.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/90734.png) [Here Stands A Brave Man [m] (5)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/31931)   
_Agree to be photographed_

Remember to make a copy of your save file in the file selection screen before talking to the photographer if you don't have the achievement below yet. Go to the camera house east of the cave where BowWow is held captive and agree to being photographed.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/90735.png) [Beautiful! I'll call this 'Game Over' [m] (5)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/31932)   
_Keep refusing to be photographed_

Remember to make a copy of your save file in the file selection screen before talking to the photographer if you don't have the achievement above yet. Go to the camera house east of the cave where BowWow is held captive and continuously refuse to be photographed.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/223968.png) [Chomping The Chain That Binds [m] (5)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/201700)   
_Rescue BowWow damageless without having Roc's Feather or the Shield equipped. (leave dungeon to retry)_

-=MISSABLE=- 

Enter the cave with only the sword equipped, then defeat all enemies without taking damage. The first room has one aggressive Moblin, the second room four non-aggressive Moblins, and the final room a miniboss. Stay as far away from him as you can while he throws arrows, then when he charges, let him crash into a wall and start whaling on him with the sword. If you do take damage, exit the cave.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/223974.png) [Bottle Grotto Cartographer [m] (10)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/201706)   
_Enter every room in Bottle Grotto (last room must be the room after the boss. Get Instrument to Trigger)._

-=MISSABLE=-

Charter the whole second dungeon before fighting the boss. If you got the map, press start and check if there are no grayed-out rooms anymore.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/223976.png) [The Goodest of Metal Doges [m] (5)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/201708)   
_Have BowWow point out all the available dig spots where Sea Shells are in one session._

-=MISSABLE=-

There are a total of 4 locations where you need to bring BowWow. There will be a dialogue box on confirmation.

1) Inside the small doghouse where BowWow lives.
2) On the screen right of the third dungeon, climb the stairs and go left. You need the Roc's Feather to get here.
3) One screen south-west of the Witch's house is a specific patch of land with grass surrounding it. You need the L-1 Bracelet to get here.
4) South-west of the Seashell Mansion is a higher platform with an owl statue. 1 square south-west of this statue is the seashell.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/223977.png) [That Aweful Beast! [m] (1)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/201709)   
_Have Richard kick you out because you brought BowWow._

-=MISSABLE=-

While BowWow is accompanying you, go to Richard's house south-east of the third dungeon and talk to him.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/223978.png) [Kiki vs Bow-Wow [m] (1)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/201710)   
_Chase off Kiki the Monkey with BowWow_

-=MISSABLE=-

While BowWow is accompanying you, go east of the castle's entrance where Kiki is waiting. Approach him and a short cutscene will play out.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/223986.png) [Richard's Golden Leaves [m] (10)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/201718)   
_Collect the 5 Golden Leaves without taking damage. (see comments)_

-=MISSABLE=-

You need to get all 5 Golden Leaves without taking damage, so be sure to make a save file right before attempting this. If you collect one and get hit, you have to reset the game.

The Bow is very useful for this achievement, although it is unlikely that you'll have 980 rupees by this point. Be sure to bring enough bombs at the very least. You can't rely on the Guardian Acorn too much here because you have to go inside- and outside multiple times. Best advice I can give for every room until the final one with the miniboss is to charge up your sword to kill every enemy in one hit. Use Magical Powder to get rid of the fireballs. For the miniboss, keep your distance and throw bombs at him (or arrows if you have the bombs).

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/223987.png) [More Holes Than Swiss Cheese [m] (5)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/201719)   
_Get the Slime Key without taking damage (exit and reenter area to retry)._

-=MISSABLE=-

After bringing the 5 Golden Leaves to Richard, enter his garden. Slash every bush in front of you and avoid the holes. You need to go one screen right, then down, in the same screen up again, use the Roc's Feather here to get across a gap, and then one screen left to reach your destination. If you end up falling down, get back to the entrance of the garden and enter + exit the cave for a retry.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/223989.png) [Key Cavern Cartographer [m] (10)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/201721)   
_Enter every room in Key Cavern (last room must be the room after the boss. Get Instrument to Trigger)._

-=MISSABLE=-

Charter the whole third dungeon before fighting the boss. If you got the map, press start and check if there are no grayed-out rooms anymore.

***

### Achievements only available before clearing the fourth dungeon

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/223990.png) [Dream within a Dream [m] (5)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/201722)   
_Complete the Dream Shrine by opening both chests in one visit damageless._

-=MISSABLE=-

This achievement can only be unlocked after obtaining the Pegasus Boots. If you opened the other chest earlier then... I'm sorry, no achievement for you. Anyway, kidding aside, use your Pegasus Boots throughout the entire shrine as you can't take damage by charging though (and killing) the enemies. If you do somehow end up taking damage, re-enter the shrine for another attempt. DO THIS ACHIEVEMENT BEFORE YOU DO THE FOLLOWING ONES AS YOU NEED THE ITEM THAT'S INSIDE, AND ALSO TALK TO MARIN AT THE WINDMILL RIGHT AFTER.

_Read Marin's note, find her at the beach, and take her to a scenic cliff in one session._

-=MISSABLE=-

Marin's note is in her own house. After reading it, go to the far east side of the beach, then go to the most south-western screen there is and stand on the cliff. As stated during the "The Travels of THIEF [m]" achievement, you must have talked to the photographer before attempting this.

_While at the Windmill, Dig a Hole, Play the Ocarina, and Get your photo taken with Marin in one session._

-=MISSABLE=-

Reminder that you need to have done "Dream within a Dream [m]" before this, and also talked to Marin right after to learn a song for the Ocarina. If done, do what the description says at the windmill. As stated during the "The Travels of THIEF [m]" achievement, you must have talked to the photographer before attempting this.

_See all dialogue for breaking pots, opening drawers, and hitting cuckoos with Marin in one session._

-=MISSABLE=-

While Marin is accompanying you, go to Marin's house and open the drawer, throw pots and hit the cuckoo outside. The pots and cuckoo hitting both have two dialogues, so keep doing it over and over again until you got both dialogues. This may unfortunately take a bit due to RNG.

1) Enter and immediately leave the dungeon.
2) Enter the dungeon and wait there for a good amount of time, then leave.
3) Enter the dungeon and get hit until you have 1 heart left, then leave.

_Travel through the Yarna Desert and get the Key damageless (leave desert to retry)._

-=MISSABLE=-

Get to the Yarna Desert south of the animal village, and keep going north until you reach the worm/lanmolas boss. Unlike his Link to the Past counterpart, there won't be any rocks coming out of the ground, so just wait for him to come out and then hit him with a charged slash attack. This generally shouldn't be too difficult but if it ends up troublesome, get out and back in the desert for a retry.

_Get the Boss Key in Angler's Tunnel without having the Flippers._

-=MISSABLE=-

The flippers are in the chest behind the miniboss, so don't open that chest yet. Instead, continue to the room with the 5 squares and memorize the pattern, then repeat that in the room south-west of it with another 5 squares but surrounded by water. Be wary that this room is kind of buggy without having the flippers, so sometimes landing on a square does not light it up. If that happens, either try jumping on it from a different angle, or re-enter the dungeon for the pattern to change.

_Kill the Master Stalfos in the first encounter using Bomb Arrows and get the small key. (reset to retry)_

-=MISSABLE=-

In the fifth dungeon when encountering the miniboss for the first time, get him to fall apart with the sword and then equip both the bombs and arrows. Press the A and B button at the same time to launch Bomb Arrows at the Stalfos. Do this four times, then grab the key.

***

_Defeat Master Stalfos in the last 3 encounters without taking damage throughout the stage (no bomb arrows)_

-=MISSABLE=-

This can potentially be a difficult achievement so be sure to have save files ready before attempting this. The miniboss will be appearing throughout the stage three more time in a specific order, with the amount of blocks in the corners of the room indicating what order. The third encounter is north-west of the second encounter, and the fourth is to the far west of the entrance beyond the stairs. Hit the Stalfos from the right and then place a bomb on his corpse (no Bomb Arrows!). Do this four time and he moves to the next room.

Having done the Color Dungeon for increased defense is definitely a recommendation, as well as picking up a Guardian Acorn. With both, you can take one free hit which may just be enough for you. Also, the Ocarina with the song learnt from the fishes west of the fourth dungeon can bring you back to the entrance of the dungeon, which could be useful for the final encounter with the Stalfos. I unfortunately don't have too many other recommendations, but putting the shield on the second slot can also potentially avoid damage.

_Defeat Gohma damageless, armed with only an Ocarina and a Bow. (Play the Ocarina at least once)._

-=MISSABLE=-

As stated, both the Ocarina with Marin's song and the Bow are required. Whenever you play the Ocarina, the Gohma's freeze in place. When they open their eyes, quickly shoot an arrow and then move left/right to avoid a fireball shot at you. Keep doing this until they are both dead.

_Go all the way through the Small Face Shrine (including the Statue section) and get the key damageless._

-=MISSABLE=-

Be sure to bring a lot of arrows. Go to the Small Face Shrine area north-east of the animal village. This achievement should pose no trouble if you got the bow, as the statues move very slowly and die after one arrow. Do watch out for the slimes popping out of the ground however. For the boss, just stand south and keep shooting arrows at it, no problemo.

***

_Open all five treasure chests in one screen of Tall, Tall Mountain._

-=MISSABLE=-

This cave is reached by bombing a wall in a cave leading to the Eagle's Tower, specifically the one with the shallow water and one square without water. When entering the room with the chests, do not open any chests and instead leave the cave through the south exit. Then re-enter to make the puzzle a lot easier.

First get the chest that is not blocked, then the one on the right by pushing the square away from it. Do the same on the right, then aim for the top-left chest and finally the one on the right by just pushing the stone downwards.

_After collapsing the tower, defeat the Grim Creeper in Eagle's Tower damageless._

-=MISSABLE=-

Collapse the tower first before attempting this miniboss, who is on the third floor. This should be a pretty easy miniboss to deal with. Just stand in the very south of the room right in the middle and then swing your sword when the birds come towards you. I'm pretty sure his starting patterns is always the same and when every bird has been killed, the fight is over.

_Pick up either the Guardian Acorn or Triangle of Power, then while one is active, pick up the other._

When killing enemies, don't ever pick up a Guardian Acorn or Triangle of Power before every enemy on the screen is dead. If both are on screen, pick up one and then the other. This may come naturally over the course of the game but if not, try going to screens with multiple enemies or ones that respawn, like the red enemies in the screen south-west of the witch's house, or hitting the coconuts dropped by the monkey on the beach.

_Get every item from the Trendy Game in one visit._

You need to get all 5 items in one visit from the Crane shop in Mabe Village. An easy guaranteed way to always pick up something is to keep your crane in the top left of the conveyor belt. Then, when an item is on the exact middle of the right conveyor belt going upwards, tap the A button. Remember to talk to the shopkeeper after you got everything.

_Catch every fish in the Fishing Pond in one round. (Answer Yes to Fish Again after catching #5)_

Go to the fishing spot north of BowWow's house and keep fishing until every fish is gone, then answer yes when asked to do more fishing. Fishing is pretty easy, just be sure that you throw the hook right of the enemy by using the D-Pad to ensure you can catch them. Keep pressing A quickly to reel in a fish. If you threw the hook to far, you can just get it closer with the A button.

_Kill the two Hardhat Beetles to the left of the entrance inside Tail Cave at the same time._

Go to the Tail Cave and immediately go one screen left to find the Hardhat Beetles. The title of the achievement already hints at it, but the easiest way to accomplish this is by luring them close to the edge and then dropping a bomb, causing them both to fall off at the exact same time.

_Defeat the four ghosts in top-right section of the Graveyard._

This achievement may be a bit flaky but I got it on my first try, so my apologies if I'm not of too much help. Go to the top-right screen of the graveyard where there are 6 gravestones, then walk into each of them until all ghosts are displayed on screen, then kill them. Killing one should kill all the remaining ones.

***

This involves a lengthy trading sequence available right from the start of the game. Finishing Catfish's Maw is required to be able to complete this sequence.

1) Get Yoshi's Doll from the Crane shop, give it to the woman with a baby in the north house of Mabe Village who gives you a Ribbon.
2) Exchange this Ribbon for Canned Food with the small dog in the BowWow's pen.
3) Exchange this Canned Food for Bananas with the crocodile over at the beach.

_Kill every animal in Mabe Village. (Don't leave village)_

I'm not 100% certain if the Fire Rod from the eight dungeon is needed but since this achievement can be done at any time, return to the village at the end of the game and kill every animal with the Fire Rod. Remember that there is also a Cuckoo on the screen below the fishing spot.

_Collect every Map, Compass, and Stone Beak in all 9 dungeons._

For this achievement, I am not 100% sure if it is missable. After all, I complete dungeons 100% on my first visit so there was no chance for me to be missing out on it, but you can revisit any dungeons at any time regardless (for the Bottle Grotto, the Fire Rod is required for access again). Regardless, every dungeon has a Map, a Compass, and a Stone Beak. Before leaving a dungeon, press the Start button and check if all three are present in the right side of the screen. If not, you missed a chest. The Compass gives a ring whenever a screen has an item you haven't gotten yet, and also shows on the map on the start screen what rooms have unopened treasure.

_Complete the overworld map._

_Collect 100 Rupees in the Raft Game._

Go to the Raft Game that's east of the fourth dungeon. The Hookshot is required to get there, but you can also take the cave above the rock maze near Face Shrine. For this minigame, it's best to go all the way to the left first, then fall down the waterfalls two times. Collect every Rupee on your way here by using the Roc's Feather, then just follow the waves to the right. Go down, then left, and on this screen stay as far south as you can to be taken to a wave section with multiple rupees back to back.

_Talk to every owl statue on the island._

The description does not state this but I _think_ you have to talk to every statue in one session. Regardless, talk to every single statue on your first visit because maybe you don't need to, and that will save a nice amount of time.

1) Outside of the cave where BowWow is held captive.
2) In the screen north-east of Mr. Write, north-west of the forest.
3) In Richard's Garden at the very end where you find the Slime Key.
4) On a higher platform west of the rock maze, south-west of the Seashell Mansion.
5) In the screen south of Catfish's Maw with the bridge you can go under.

_Get the boomerang_

After obtaining the Magnifying Lens from the "Magnifying Lens" achievement, go to the beach and find a cave that needs a bomb to be entered (a screen east of where you initially found the sword). Trade in the item that is in your B slot (preferably the Shovel). Don't worry, you can trade this item back at any time, so your Shovel won't be lost forever. You just won't need it again after digging up all the Seashells required.
