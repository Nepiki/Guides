## 2) Introduction

The Legend of Hero Tonma is an action game. The story, a princess has been kidnapped and it is up to you to save her. The game is pretty straight forward, go through each level, defeat the boss and move on to the next. The game has a total of 15 achievements, worth a total of 150 points. 

## 3) Walkthrough

**Step 1**

Really, this should be the only step. The only case where it should be two steps, is if you somehow miss the score achievements or are not able to get to 6 lives showing on your lives counter.

_Get your Hi-Score to 50,000 in the first level alone._

This one is grindy so the best thing to do, is find a spot, move back and forth, enemies will keep coming back, and just kill them and eventually you will get this.

_Get 4 lives._

While it is very hard to miss, it is possible. All you need to do is collect a single live, you can get one through score or you can get 2 in two separate levels, stage 3 and stage 6. If you however die before you get these lives or do not get them at all, you will need to play from the beginning.

_Get your Hi-Score to 200,000._

This one can be a grind, especially if you die from time to time. The best way to do this is find a place where lots of enemiesâ€™ spawn but are easy to kill. Enemies will respawn when you go back and forth and will not stay dead. This will allow you to go back and forth just killing enemies.

**-=MISSABLE=-**   

_Get 6 lives (Displays as 5 in game)._

This is the most missable achievement in the game. I have only found 3 lives you can get in this entire game. One from points and the other two from levels. So you need to get them all without dying which means you will need to get to at least stage 6 with no deaths.
