# 2) Introduction

So are you ready? Deception is a game about, well that, deception. You play as the prince of Zemekia, who after returning home is framed for murdering his father. You narrowly escape being executed for treason only to find your way to the Castle of the Damned. After arriving, your very own revenge story begins!
The set is designed around general progression like upgrading everything and viewing all 6 endings, challenges based on the end of chapter results, as well as smaller chapter specific events. It may appear daunting at first but this guide here is to break it down so that it isn't overwhelming! There will be some tips and tricks that will help with cleaning up any achievements you may miss, without requiring an additional full playthrough later on!

# 3) Walkthrough

[**Step 1: First Playthrough!**]

The primary focus of this playthrough will be to simply enjoy the game without worrying too much about all of the achievements. The achievements are ordered based off of chapter so if you follow the achievement list you should be able to see the general challenges of that specific chapter. They will also support trigger so whenever you're at the point for an achievement, it will show in the bottom right hand corner that you're at the right point!

There are 6 endings to the game, and I will include a table later in which explains how to get all of them, however do not worry about which ending you get on this playthrough as a second playthrough is required to get all 6 endings. 4 are possible on first playthrough and you can get the other 2 on the second.

Whilst working through your first playthrough, the main things I'd suggest is to split up the point where you capture or kill enemies in the 3~ chapter blocks however if you don't get some of them these can be cleared up later.
As you progress through this playthrough, try and become accustomed with body collecting which becomes available from the start of chapter 2 as this allows for you to lure invaders to the castle so that you can obtain additional resources. Also become familiar with monster creation which is possible after completing chapter 6 when you can start enslaving invaders that you capture and you can then use these for monster creation.

When you reach chapter 26, try to keep a save at the start of this chapter as you can reload this to replay the last 2 chapters to obtain 4 endings per playthrough depending on choices that you select in chapters 26 and 27.

If you are given the option to resurrect at the end of chapter 8, I would recommend to do that on this playthrough, if not, make sure to do this on playthrough 2! The monster that you receive by selecting this option is not included in the achievements for levelling all monsters ("Monster Rancher" and "Castle of the Damned") and for that specific achievement I would suggest to attempt these on playthrough 3, however these can also be attempted on playthrough 2 if you feel comfortable enough, as you'll need to utilise every opportunity for exp whilst gaining as much gold as possible.

During this step you should make progress towards the following achievement types
* [**Capture Pro I-VIII**](##Capture-Pro-|-Total-points:-80)

[**Step 2: Second playthrough!**]

For this playthrough, you will want to play very similar to the first playthrough however try and do the opposite of the first playthrough for any of the chapter specific challenges for capturing/destroying all invaders. It will also be important to ensure you get the opposite outcome in chapter 8 as this will allow for you to achieve the other 2 endings in a very similar manner to the first playthrough.

***

[**Step 3: Third playthrough and clean up!**]

For the third playthrough you should be familiar with all of the systems and it's this playthrough that I would recommend to attempt for the "Castle of the Damned" achievement. The biggest difficulty for this achievement is ensuring that you can obtain enough exp for yourself to reach level 15, but also enough to level up all of the monsters. This achievement is the most difficult as there is a limited amount of exp that you can gain throughout the game and you will also be spending all of your gold on block orbs so that you can summon monsters to gain exp with them.

Each monster you summon has an associated cost which you pay with block orbs. Each block orb costs 300 gold from the merchant, and for C-B rank monsters, each summon costs between 2 to 6 block orbs (600 to 1800 gold per summon!)
I would recommend levelling up monsters to B rank by having them deal damage to enemies, but not letting them finish the enemy off, and getting the exp for yourself on the killing blow. Later into the game when you have more resources available and you start getting closer to level 15, start allowing the monsters to get the killing blow as they will receive more exp this way. You can deal damage via destroy traps to weaken them and allow the monster to finish them off if wanting to maximise the amount of exp from gold.

Due to the time restraint to get exp, you will also want to ensure you can create a monster as soon as possible. The best way to do this would be via body collecting after finishing chapter 6 and luring a wizard, soldier and pirate. If all 3 arrive, then a cleric should also arrive. Ensure you enslave all of these via capture methods for monster creation as the soldier, pirate and cleric are required to create a zombie. You will also require a wizard to create a phantom so it's good to get that now so it's easier to get later.

If all 4 of those enemies don't show up, you can split this across a couple of chapters where you lure less however it is luck based if they actually arrive.

# 4) General gameplay tips and tricks

You will obtain different resources depending on how you take out an invader. 
* If you capture them, you will have the choice to obtain either MP, gold, or enslave them (last one after finishing chapter 6)
* If you destroy them, they will drop a bag of gold
You will want to maximise what types of resources you receive however the resources that are generally most valuable are gold and enslaving for monster creation. You will need to capture 1 of every enemy type that can be captured, and some require you to capture 2-3 of them.
When playing through the game, make sure to make backups! You can only keep one save on the memory card due to the game requiring 8 slots, so backing up memory cards will help cleaning up any chapter specific challenges that you missed a lot easier to get back to.

I would recommend to keep a save backed up at the start of the chapter every 3 chapters, starting from chapter 4, so chapters 4, 7, 10 etc when the "capture pro" and "destroy pro" achievements begin. You can backup a save by making a copy of the memory card after saving at those points in the game, and can then copy them back to the memory card the emulator reads when needed. Just make sure the name of the memory card matches the name of the game when you go to open them! If you are unsure how to backup and restore a memory card this way feel free to reach out either via the website or discord and I'll help however I can.

A great guide for the game without spoilers can be found at the following link. This includes an overview of how to obtain all 6 endings at the very bottom as well as a lot of chapter specific information.

The following guide is also useful for very specific bits of information as it has a lot more detail, however isn't as well formatted overall and does include spoilers, so be warned! It does include Shadow's Weakness however for the "General Pelipper" achievement (yes the name is a Pokemon reference, and it's a hint towards their weakness!)
