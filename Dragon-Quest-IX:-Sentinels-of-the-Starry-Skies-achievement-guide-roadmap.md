**Introduction**

Welcome to Dragon Quest IX: Sentinels of the Starry Skies (DQ9), RetroAchievement's 2021 set of the year! It is the ninth installment in the mainline Dragon Quest series and was released on Nintendo DS in 2009. For the first time in the series, DQ9 gives you complete control over the customization of your party.  You create the main character, any allies you would like to take along with you on the journey and have freedom to change jobs throughout the majority of the experience.

The game can be thought of as having two parts to it. The first is a very well done, but fairly standard JRPG plotline. After the main quest, the real work on the set begins in the post game content. Blendedsea created an extraordinarily thorough DQ9 experience with this 164 achievement set. Mastering it will involve seeing nearly all of the entire game's expansive content. It is a very time consuming set to master, however there are reliable ways to manipulate the post game RNG so that you won't feel like you are at the mercy of randomness.

Here is my save file data immediately after mastering the set.  Note that while the game time is nearly 500 hours, I played virtually all of it on fast forward and thus it took me about 165 real time hours.

There are essentially five main components to mastering the set: **the main story and missable boss achievements, completing the full 307 item bestiary, mastering all 26 skills and 12 job classes, completing all side quests, obtaining all items and alchemies**. This guide will break the set down into five primary corresponding sections.


**Resources**


You will need to begin the game with a save file that has had the DLC activated. **Blendedsea has provided a starting save file for this purpose in [the second post of the game's official forum topic.](https://retroachievements.org/viewtopic.php?t=11708)  I HIGHLY recommend using his "MALE" save file as the RNG seed information for that save file will be referenced in this guide.** Additionally, it would not be reasonable to include every single thing needed to master the set in this guide, so instead I will reference other stand alone guides that are complete and fully sufficient for mastering the set.  All of these resources will be thorough explained in this guide when referenced.

**Part 1: The main quest and 12 of the 13 missable achievements**


Primary resource: [Main storyline guide](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ds/937281-dragon-quest-ix-sentinels-of-the-starry-skies/faqs/60437)

The main story of DQ9 should take approximately 50 hours to complete. The general gameplay loop throughout the story is the traditional model of arriving in a new location, having to solve a particular problem, gaining access to a new location and repeating.  As you play through the story you will naturally get many of the progress achievements, but the majority of bosses have additional missable achievements as well.  This section will provide a general guide for the story and highlight how to ensure none of the missable achievements are accidentally skipped.  You will likely also get several other achievements for specific side quests, item collection, skill mastery, monster/bestiary encounters and more throughout your main story play through.  This is not a problem and doesn't matter either way at this point.

Also, you will not be limited with your skill points, so do not be concerned with spending them.  Make sure to prioritize the class skills for each vocation as well as shield and sword skills for everyone at some point.  You'll have plenty opportunities to do this later, but getting an early jump on it is helpful.

The following are missable achievements which will be described below in appropriate chronological order

Achievements in the main quest

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/163150.png) **None Winged Angel** (3 points)

Help the citizens of Angel Falls, and begin your true journey

_Story-related and can't be missed_

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/163151.png) **Hexagoon** (5 points)

Defeat Hexagoon

_Story-related and can't be missed_

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/163170.png) **More like Hexagone [m]** (10 points)

Defeat Hexagoon with nothing equipped

_As the achievement says, ensure you are fully unequipped prior to entering the battle with Hexagoon.  You can still use medicinal herbs to heal by having them in your inventory, just no actual equipment (weapons, armor, accessories) equipped.  Level 10 or 11 will be sufficient for this_

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/163171.png) **I Need a Hero [m]** (10 points)

Defeat the Wight Knight using only the Hero

_Speak with Patty at the counter in the Stornway inn to drop off all party members.  Fill up the hero's inventory with medicinal herbs.  Ensure the hero is around level 15 and save at the church in Stornway prior to the fight.  With a little pattern luck, this fight should not be a significant challenge_

**Note once you reach Stornway, at the Inn you will be able to recruit additional party members.  For an upcoming missable achievement, make sure to recruit 3 priests so they have time to level up.**

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/163152.png)  **Morag** (5 points)

Defeat Morag, returning peace to a fellow Knight

_Story-related and can't be missed_

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/163298.png) **Stornway Treasury** (2 points)

Obtain your well-deserved reward from King Schott

_After defeating Morag, return to Stornway and talk to King Schott.  This will unlock the treasury.  Go up the stairs behind his throne and follow the path to it.  The achievement will pop when you open the treasures_

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/163153.png) **The Ragin' Contagion** (5 points)

Defeat the Ragin' Contagion, cleansing the curse over Coffinwell

_Story-related and can't be missed_

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/163172.png) **The Doctors are in the House [m]** (10 points)

Defeat the Ragin' Contagion with 3 Priests in your party

_The 3 priests you initially recruited should be sufficiently leveled by now so this achievement should be quite simple without any additional preparation_

**You no longer need 3 priests in the party.  I recommend keeping 1 priest and having at least 2 members who can start allocating skill points in the Sword Skill.  It will be very useful later**

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/163154.png) **Master of Nu'un** (5 points)

Defeat Master of Nu'un, allowing the world to change vocations once again

_Story-related and can't be missed_

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/163173.png) **Master of Nothing [m] (10 points)

Defeat Master of Nu'un without having a party member die

_With a priest keeping up on the healing, this should not be especially difficult.  If a party member does die, just reset immediately and try again.  If difficulty persists, level up a couple times with each character and it should make the fight more manageable_
