# 0) Author Information

Hello there, I'm Nepiki! I'm a gamer who has an unofficial case of amnesia so I have an obsession with writing everything down so I don't forget about it! Joking aside, I do genuinely like writing, especially if it helps out other people. I don't have a lot of guides yet, but expect to see more pop up in the future!

For everything me related, here are some links you can check out:

# 2) Introduction

# 3) Walkthrough

[**Step 1: Story/Bosses Achievements**](#step-1-storybosses-achievements--total-points-97)

All of these achievements are either unlocked through the story, or can be obtained at any given time. Some bosses are optional, but I've listed them in this section as well.

[**Step 2: No-damage Bosses (7 missable)**](#step-2-no-damage-bosses-7-missable--total-points-95)

The achievements for defeating all the bosses without taking damage. All aside from the very final boss are missable, as the bosses do not return once you defeat them.
**note: Due to me umm, not being that good at no-damage bosses, I was unable to defeat 5 of the 8 bosses without taking damage. Therefore, I can only give hints and tricks, but there are probably other people who can help better. Apologies in advance.**

[**Step 3: Miscellaneous Achievements (6 missable)**](#step-3-miscellaneous-achievements-6-missable--total-points-158)

All sorts of miscellaneous achievements, ranging from bomb creation to completion of the map. There are 6 missable achievements, and it is important that you read this before you are unable to complete the game:

- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 

Whenever you try to combine a bomb component with a boomerang or a clock, there are two possible bombs to get. Due to it being completely random and items being limited, it is possible that you constantly get one but not the other. Save your game before you make the bombs and reset the game if you get the wrong one, as the chance will reset every time.
