# 2) Walkthrough

Hexsalkia Castle (Tutorial)

Elthard Village エルサードの町

**Dungeon 1: Grassland Ruins 草原の遺跡**

In the room with the invisible monsters attack the dark element (?) and insert a Key Element to the pedestal to make the monsters visible.

闇の光は魔物を強くする。闇の光を打ち砕く、キーエレメントの光で魔物を照らせ！
The glow of darkness strenghtens monsters. Shatter the glow of darkness and illuminate the monsters with the light of the key elements.

In the room with the 4 colored Key Element buttons you need to insert them in the correct order to enter the boos room.

日は海よりいずりし、紫の雲路は森へと帰る。
The sun leaves the sea, and the purple clouds return to the forest
(Red -> Blue -> Purple -> Green)

Boss fight: Hell Hound 

Acquire first Global Element (First Magic Slot)

**Dungeon 2: Waterfall Cave 滝の洞窟**

Boss Fight: Venom

**Dungeon 3: Stone Ruins 石の遺跡**

Boss Fight: Razor Back

**Optional Dungeon: Tomb of the Wealthy Family 豪族の墓**
After coming back from the stone ruins a stairway will open that lead from the area around the Grassland Ruins to the tomb. You can acquire the Book of Confusion here, which the Witch in Elthard Village will need to unlock level 2 spells.
After Dungeon 5 an old woman will appear next to the save point in the middle of the village. She we will tell you about deeper secrets being hidden in the tombs by illusion magic. You can now return here and get a second book: The book of enlightenment. You can then unlock level 3 spells.
