## 2) Introduction

Harvest Moon 64 can be argued to be one of the best Harvest Moon games out there. The primary goal is to raise a farm and do well enough by year 3 to be allowed to continue. In the game you will grow crops, raise farm animals, you can get married and have kids and compete in festivals. Along with various other side quests in the game.

Due to this game having so many mechanics for dating and such, I will be including some information at the end of this guide for each of the marriage candidates and other information.

## 3) Walkthrough

**Step 1**

The first step is the play the game. There is a lot to this game, it is a game to be played over a long period of time The following achievements you should be able to get through normal play through, if you miss them before your evaluation, you should be able to get them as you continue. They are as follows:

**Step 2**
In this step, is basically everything that can be missed, or you can choose not to do. Typically, if you miss these in your first playthrough, you can start over and go strictly for them however since there is so much missible and you only have a single chance to get them, or you have to make choices, I recommend using another save file or, especially for the girls, get their affection up all around the same time, same with the rivals. That way you can trigger their marriages, then reset and reload your game and go for the next one. Therefore I am saying step two is your marriages because there are a lot of achievements that are affected by your marriage and who you marry. This method will cut down greatly on the time needed and the number of play throughs. If you don’t do this method, expect at least 5 play throughs. So as for the “cleanup,” the achievements are as follows:

## 4) Achievements

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138306.png) [Town Introduction]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99513)  
_Have the Mayor show you around town and introduce you to the villagers._  
**-=Missable=-**

This one is rather simple and just takes time. When you first start, when you leave your house, the mayor will be standing there, and you will talk to him. He offers to show you around town, accept and watch it play out. It will use up a few in game hours but it is not big deal. You will be awarded the achievement when the event is over.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138305.png) [Binge Watcher]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99514)  
_Turn on the TV and watch all the channels._  

Quick and easy, in your house is a TV, the most useful thing for me is the weather but there are multiple channels. Essentially turn it on and flip through them and you’ll be awarded the achievement.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138304.png) [Slacker!]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99515)  
_Take a nap during the day._  

Very easy, if you just stand there and waste away your time not moving, you will eventually lay down and start taking a nap. So just waste your precious minutes of the quick day, drop the controller and let yourself fall asleep. If you really want that time back, just save before and reload so you are not wasting the little time in each day.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138303.png) [Fresh Farmer]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99516)

_ Accumulate 10,000 Gold._  

See [Master Farmer]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99519)  

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138301.png) [Veteran Farmer]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99518)

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138300.png) [Master Farmer]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99519)  
_ Accumulate 100,000 Gold._  

Money is something you will earn throughout the game as you ship crops and animal goods. Just save your money and plant as much as possible and get your farm animals when you can. The more you ship, the more cash you get, eventually you will earn the money achievements as you go.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138324.png) [Giddy Up!]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99529)   
_ Get and name your horse._  

This can be gotten as soon as your first day and I recommend getting it then as well. You will need to trigger the cutscene anyway if you wanted to get farm animals anyway. All you need to do is head to Green Ranch, leave your farm and go south, and once you get there, it will trigger the scene. Get it, name it and you’ll get the achievement.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138327.png) [The Bird is the Word]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99526)  
_ Get and name your first chicken._  

This one is simply enough, head to Green Ranch and in the far-right building, enter it and you will have the option to buy livestock. Buy one, name it and you’ll get your achievement.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138295.png) [Poultry Farmer]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99449)  
_ Acquire 6 Chickens._  

Just as you did with the first chicken, you can buy all your chickens at Green Ranch until you have a coop with 6 chickens. Alternatively, if you want to save money, you can put them in the nesting spot in your coop and they will hatch into baby chicks over time. If you are buying, you can only get one chicken per day.  Also note, do not leave your chickens outside in the winter or rain, or you do not feed them,  they can become sick and eventually die. 

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138326.png) [Lively Livestock]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99527)
_Get and name your first barn animal._

Just like with the chickens, you can buy sheep or cows from Green Ranch. They are more expensive but their by products are worth more. Go to the ranch and buy either a sheep or a cow, name it and you’ll get the achievement.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138323.png) [Livestock Farmer]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99530)  
_Have a full barn of livestock._

Like others, you can head to Green Ranch and buy all your livestock, either cows or sheep, or a mixture of them will work. I find it easier to buy them as raising them from birth can take a very long time and close to two months before the calf is born and grown to be able to produce products. Also, like with the chickens, do not leave them out in the rain, or in winter and always feed them. Also note that you can only buy sheep, only cows can be impregnated.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138325.png) [My Animal Family]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99528)  
_Fill your Chicken Coop and Barn with animals._

Get 6 chickens and 8 barn animals either through buying or from eggs/impregnating. This will pop once you have the maximum number of animals you can get.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138318.png) [Cabbage Patch]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/125547)  
_Ship a total of 100 cabbages._

Cabbages are a Spring crop and takes 9 days to grow and seeds cost 200G. They take a longest in the season to grow but once you ship 100, the achievement will trigger.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138317.png) [Mr. Potato Head]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/125548)  
_Ship a total of 100 Potatoes._

Potatoes are a Spring crop that take 6 days to grow and cost 200G to buy the seeds. Plant them in Spring and after you ship 100 of them, the achievement will trigger.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138316.png) [These “Turnip” Everywhere]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/125549)  
_Ship a total of 100 Turnips._

Turnips are a Spring crop that takes 4 days to grow and the seeds cost 200G.  These are the fastest the grow and you can plant a lot in the season. Once you ship 100 of them the achievement will trigger.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138315.png) [Corn Maize]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/125550)  
_Ship a total of 100 corn._

Corn is a Summer crop that will take 13 days to grow and costs 300G for the seeds. The nice thing about corn is that it will regrow after 4 days making. So while it takes a long time to grow, you will get a continuous crop of it until the end of the season. Ship 100 and you will get the achievement.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138314.png) [Not for Throwing]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/125551)  
_Ship a total of 100 Tomatoes._

Tomatoes are a Summer crop, they take 9 days to grow and cost 300G. Like corn, they will also regrow and will do so every 3 days until the end of the season. Grow and ship 100 of them and you will get the achievement.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138313.png) [Egg Head]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/125552)  
_Ship a total of 100 Eggplants._  

Eggplant is a Fall crop and is really the only Fall crop there is. It takes 7 days to grow, costs 300G for the seeds. Like corn and tomatoes, it will regrow and will do so after 3 days. Ship 100 of these and the achievement will trigger.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138312.png) [Very Berry]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/125553)  
_Ship a total of 100 Strawberries._  

You can buy Strawberry seeds in Winter. However, to grow them you will need a greenhouse. They will only grow in the greenhouse. The seeds cost 500G to buy and they will grow after 5 days. They will not regrow. Once you grow and ship 100 of them, the achievement will trigger.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138311.png) [Shipped for Breakfast]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/125554)  
_Ship a total of 100 Eggs._  

For this, you will need chickens. The more chickens the more eggs you will get. You will get one egg per chicken each day. Keep in mind that not feeding them or leaving them out in the winter or rain, can make the sick and they will not produce any eggs. But once you get 100 and ship them, you will get the achievement.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138310.png) [Got Milk?]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/125555)  
_Ship a total of 100 Milk._  

For Milk, you will need cows. Only cows can be milked, so don’t bother trying to milk your sheep (or other animals…). You can get 1 milk per day per cow so the more cows you get, the faster you will get this. Ship 100 milk over the course of your game and you will be awarded this achievement.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138328.png) [Tools of the Trade]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99525)  
_Fully upgrade all your field tools._  

All of your tools will upgrade over time as you use them. Essentially each tool will gain a level when you hit a certain number of times using them. Each tool has a different number of times it has to be used for it to upgrade, the number of times are as follows:

**Hoe:** 300 uses to silver, another 300 to gold.  
**Hammer:** 100 uses to silver, another 100 to gold.  
**Axe:** 450 uses to silver, another 450 to gold.  
**Watering Can:** 600 uses to silver, another 600 to gold.  
**Sickle:** 350 to silver, another 350 to gold.  

It is possible to get your tools to gold at the start of the game in a single night. If you head to the bar, time will freeze and you can jus go keep using your tools in the bar and they will get use towards their level up. Once you run out of stamina, you can order water and then keep going. This is tedious and time consuming but can be done. Personally, I would just let them level up naturally as you play but if you want them right from the start, you can do this.

_Have your child and get your picture._   
**-=Missable=-**   

To have a child you need to get married and maintain your high affection with your wife for at least a month so keep giving her gifts every day to keep her happy (Pretty sad… you gotta buy her happiness). Over time, you can tell she is pregnant as she will change what she talks about and eventually she will tell you she is pregnant. During the pregnancy, you want to keep her happy, otherwise the pregnancy will last longer. After the pregnancy happens and your child is born, you will get the picture in your album and this achievement will trigger.

**Note:** While typically everyone gets married when they play this game, it is possible to not get married at all and have all your rivals get married taking all the girls making this achievement impossible to get!

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138290.png) [Nuts of Power]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/125585)  
_Get all the Power Nuts._   

Power Nuts, also called a Power Berry, in this game are what will increase your stamina. There are 10 in total, and they can be found in various locations and through various methods. The methods are as follows:

**First Power Nut:** You will naturally get one just from working in your field with the hoe. It is random when it happens so there is no longing for it. It can be even on tilled soil though unless you are just grinding for it, it is better to just let it come naturally and only grind if it is the last one you are trying to get.

**Second Power Nut:** Fishing can get you a few. One is simply fish, one will eventually be caught.

**Third Power Nut:** If you catch a large fish, there is a pond in the forest by the tent, if you throw it in, an Imp will appear and give you a Power Nut.

**Fourth Power Nut:** If you catch a small fish, you can go to the pond in the mountains by the tent and the Imp will give you another one. This one is blue and you will use less stamina in rainy weather after eating it.

**Fifth Power Nut:** When you go to the mines and reach level 4, you can dig and find a Power Nut.

**Sixth Power Nut:** Win the Egg Festival and your price will be a Power Nut

**Seventh Power Nut:** During the Flower Festival, there is a travelling merchant dressed in black. You can buy one from him for 1000G

**Eighth Power Nut:** If you go to the Harvest Goddess and offer a vegetable to her in the morning, she will ask you a question, answer with Strength and she will give you a Power Nut.

**Ninth Power Nut:** In Winter, the fisherman’s pond is froze, there is a rock, go and hit it with your golden hammer as hard as you can.

**Tenth Power Nut:** You will need to plant flowers in your fields, you will need at least 8, I just planted one patch. Eventually a boy named Stu will ask for one but have no money so he will offer you marbles, take them. Afterwards, if you have not already, go make friends with the harvest sprites. When you get their friendship up enough, the one at the table will offer to trade a Power Nut for the marbles.

_Bet on one horse at the races and have it win (cannot enter your own horse)._   

The Horse Race is on Spring 17 and Fall 28, there are two horse races a year. There are 3 races in the day and I recommend getting there earlier than later because if you get there later, you may only get to do 1 or 2 of the races. Simply talk to the people at the desk and you will be able to bet on horses. Now, you can only bet on one, otherwise the achievement will not work. So bet on the horse that you think will win and watch the race. If your horse wins, you will get the achievement. If you don’t get it, you can always reload the day or wait until next race.

_Fully expand your house as well as have your Baby Bed, Cabinet and cloth your table._   

The Head Carpenter can be found in the mountains. You can speak with him, and he can give you extensions to your house for the cost of lumber and gold. You get the lumber from breaking tree stumps.

Not only do you need these upgrades, but you also need the tablecloth and the run in your house. You will need to go to the Flower Bud Bakery and enter a raffle at the end of Winter. When you buy a cake there, you will be awarded a point and the raffle costs 10 points to enter. So buy your cakes! You can also get the carpet (or rug) from Rick’s for 3,000GP.

Bring a vegetable or an egg to the pond and throw it in. She should appear. The items must also be from your farm. Bought items or foraged items will not work.

**-=Missable=-**  

This is very hard not to do and you would have to pretty not do anything all, no animals, no wife, if you don’t talk to people, don’t sell crops or make any money, then you will get the bad ending. This however, can basically lock you out from continuing and if your most recent save is today, well… I hope you have earlier ones or you are starting over. If you want to make sure you get past this, make sure you at least are married or have some animals.

_Max your dog's affection._  

This will be done over time. The max affect for your dog is 255 and it starts with 0. To increase its affection, you can do so by picking it up, whistling for it and feeding it. Just do these things and it will be maxed at some point through your game. Keep in mind that if you hit your dog, you are a bad person and you will lose affection.

_Dig up the Music Box._  

The Music Box is dug up in your field but can be hard to find if you don’t know where to look. First, you need to go to the tree on your farm and press A on it and you’ll find a treasure map, then you need to dig with your hoe and it is on the right side of the field from your dog house or if you go to the tree on your farm and go down. Really it is about the spot where the two intercept. You need to dig with your hoe at least 10 times and you will dig it up. Refer to the picture below.

_Find the weathervane in the mines._  

In Winter, you can go to the mines and to find the weathervane, you need to get down to the 4th floor and dig. I recommend bringing something to eat or refill your stamina as the way to the next floor is not always the same and is random, same with finding the weathervane.

This one is a little different as affection does not seem to be important here. On the Spring of your second year, the shop will carry blue mist seeds. When you buy them, You and Popuri will plant them near the goddess pond. You need to water these every day and after about a week or so, they will bloom. This will trigger the photo event with Popuri.

Buy the feather and give it to the girl you wish to marry and they should say yes. Now, this that said, not all the girls are the same, girl’s like Karen. With Karen you also will have needed to save the Vineyard (Outlined below). So to marry Karen, save the vineyard, get the affection up to pink heart and then give her the Blue Feather. This will trigger the marrying process and lead you to your achievement.

_Watch Ann and Cliff get married._    
**-=Missable=-**   

This involves befriending Cliff while keeping Ann’s affection lower. If Ann’s affection gets too high, you will not be able to trigger the wedding between these two. So work primarily on Cliff. The easiest way I found to get Cliff’s affection up is to give him eggs. If you are raising chickens, then you should get these daily. After his affection gets to a certain point, he will meet you outside and invite you to his wedding.

This one will involve becoming friends with Jeff while keeping Elli’s affection down as if it gets too high, like the others, you won’t be able to trigger the marriage. Jeff likes milk and absolutely loves gold milk. So if you are trying to get his affection up and you have milk producing cows, give him some. He will eventually meet you on the farm and invite you to his wedding.

**-=Missable=-**   

Like the others, this one involves getting your affection up with Gray while keeping it down with Popuri. Gray is a quiet guy, doesn’t talk much and he is kind of shy, even when he invites you to his wedding though he’ll drop hints and such when he is close in the bar. However, all you need to do is get his affection up and the best way I found for that is to using eggs. He also likes eggs which are easy enough to come by. If for some reason you don’t have them, he also likes you showing him his dog. Once his affection is up enough, he will show up on your farm and invite you to the wedding.

This one involves a little more because you will need to save the vineyard first (outlined below) while getting Kai’s affection up. If you do not save the Vineyard, Karen will leave making this impossible so make sure you save the Vineyard. The best way I found to get Kai’s affection up is to give him berries. He seems to love them. Once his affection is high enough and the Vineyard is saved, Kai will show up to your farm and invite you to the wedding.
