## 3) Walkthrough

**Step 1**

Really, in this step, I would suggest going for everything on your first play through. That however can be rather difficult, especially if you do not know the game. So really for your first step, just play the game, it isn’t very long so you can play it, get familiar and then go for the damageless/deathless next time. So first step, beat the game.

_Complete Scene 4._

**{Story related}**

This is a short level, just go left. You will eventually get to a spot with a big gap too big to jump. Pick up all the tickets to get the grenade launcher and when you get close, launch one which will make a platform fall so you can jump across.

_Complete Scene 5._

**{Story related}**

You need to climb the elevators going up, be careful as they do not seem to have much pattern. Just make sure you’re high enough before jumping to the next platform. At the top, you’ll fight the elevator so you need the rocket launcher so make sure you gather all the tickets you need. There is a bit of a delay with this shots so place them where the helicopter will be.

_Complete Scene 6._

**{Story related}**

This is another driving level. You need get to the movie theater before Benedict’s car so get as many tickets as fast as you can and turbo your way there. At the end, you’ll do a chicken race which involves button mashing so get that finger ready!

This is another straight forward level, get the tickets, use the items as you need and get to the end.

Another fight with the Ripper, this time, get all the way to the right of the screen where you see the windows and knock him in.

_Beat the game._

**{Story related}**

Basically the final boss, he’ll shoot fireballs and you gotta kick them back at him. Keep doing that until he dies.

_Beat the game without dying._

**-=MISSABLE=-**

This can be tricky, while instructions are self explanatory, the worst levels are the two driving ones and the Elevator level. They are easy to die as so make sure you get good at driving and getting those tickets for the turbo and watch your jumps when going between elevators.

_Earn a score of 50,000._

See [The Name’s Slater](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/95092)  for more details.

_Earn a score of 100,000._

This is easier than I anticipated. Killing, grabbing, doing stuff pretty much gives you points. You get this through normal playthrough, especially when going for deathless.

_Defeat the Ripper without taking damage (No Pausing)._

**-=MISSABLE=-**

This one can be annoying. You need to be care of his attacks here and don’t get too close other wise he will hit you with his axe. A tactic is when he jumps, go towards the end of the building and wait for him to jump over you again so he is only one or two hits away from falling off.

_Defeat the Helicopter without taking damage (No Pausing)._

**-=MISSABLE=-**

This is at the top of the elevator building. This actually isn’t too hard, just avoid the shots from the helicopter and launch your rockets as you see fit.

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/104811.png) [Rippen Mad](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/95095)   
_Defeat the Ripper the second time without taking damage (No Pausing)._

**-=MISSABLE=-**

Same strategy as the first one but go to the right where the window is. This is actually a little easier since he’ll walk into the sweet spot to hit him and only really needs one hit. So wait for him to get near the window and hit him and he’ll fall in.

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/104812.png) [Take That Bene-Dick](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/95096)  
_Defeat the Benedict without taking damage (No Pausing)._

**-=MISSABLE=-**

This one is easy; the hard part is the number of hits it takes. There is a spot where he will not be able to hit you so you can just go back and forth between dodging and kicking the fire balls back. Just… don’t screw up.
