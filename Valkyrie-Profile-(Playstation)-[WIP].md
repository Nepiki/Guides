## The guide

Written by [Sines](https://retroachievements.org/user/Sines), don't hesitate to ping me if you see mistakes in this guide. 

This guide is an extended and more explicit version of what was initially my routing notes. Everything has been personally tested by me and should be replicable by following the notes. **This is not a play-by-play walkthrough**, the goal is to cover all the achievements, provide a roadmap to obtain them and give tips & tricks to save on time. 

# 1) Synopsis

|Set Difficulty| 4/10, Not a very hard game but can be time-consuming|
|Approximate time to master| 40~60h depending on efficiency and use of emulator speed-up|
|Minimum numbers of playthroughs needed| 2, technically 1.5 with some key backup saves|
|Number of missable achievements| 15 as per set tag, I'd argue for more but I'll detail more when I cover them|
|Does difficulty affect achievements?|Yes, Normal & Hard mode have mutually exclusive dungeons|
|Hardest achievement of the set| [**Voices**](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108551) for the grind, [**Pest Control**](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/109422) is technically the hardest fight in the game|

# 2) Introduction

</p>

Valkyrie Profile is an RPG loosely inspired by Nordic mythology where you play as a Valkyrie tasked to retrieve the souls of dead warriors in preparation for the Ragnarok. Due to the premise, this mean that every single one of your companion in the game will die before joining you, often in terrible ways, and you will be here to watch it happen. Fun times !

The gameplay loop is a mix of exploration, with a bit of platforming, and classic RPG turn based battle with a twist. While fighting, each of your 4 team member is assigned to a right-side button X O □ ∆ and will attack when you press their symbol. It's up to you to mix & match your lineup and pay attention to their move and timing to be able to juggle and combos enemy, filling a special gauge that will then let you unleash devastating Super unique to each character. There are of course a few more systems but I'll cover them in due time. 

# 3) Walkthrough

While technically you don't need to do two full playthrough if you are already familiar enough with the game, I'd recommend to do the set in 2 playthroughs. The first one in Normal mode for the Ending B and the second one in Hard mode for the Ending A. You totally can switch which ending for which difficulty you want to tackle and a lot of the regular Normal mode dungeons are also available in Hard mode but I'll present the achievements with that order in mind.

[**Step 1: Ending B Normal Mode**](#step-1-dummy-step--total-points-999)

First playthrough, you don't have access to the harder puzzle of Hard mode dungeons but you also don't get the most powerful equipment. I'd actually recommend a Normal mode run for anyone not familiar with the game rather than easy as the difficulty works a bit backward in the game. You don't have to level all your characters from level 1 as in hard mode so don't hesitate to test different lineups and see what clicks for you. This run should cover most of the progression and misc achievements. There are a couple of missables, but nothing that wouldn't be obvious if you take time to read the achievement description.

[**Step 2: Ending A Hard Mode**](#step-2-dummy-step-2--total-points-999)

Now that you are familiar with the game, this should be a breeze to go through for the most part. While everyone recruited start at level 1, you have access to enough tools to make it a blessing in disguise for customization. Hard mode dungeons are not necessarily harder from the enemies and boss encounters but more due to their puzzles and gimmick. I wont provide a full solution of those outside of a bit of advice here and there based on my experience. If not already the case, this run should also cover any story mode Misc achievements that you did not get through the Ending B playthrough. It's also here that you should prepare the most for postgame as this is the save you will need to use to access it if you want to unlock everything.

[**Step 3: Postgame and Misc**](#step-3-dummy-step-3--total-points-999)

This last step will cover the postgame, unlocked by having a save in the last dungeon of the respective ending. Called the Seraphic Gate, you will have to run through it once for the usual map/treasure/boss completion achievements, find a couple of bonus fight and this is also where you will have to engage the biggest grind of the game to unlock 100% Voice clip completion. I'll also use this part to cover the non-story specific achievements that can (and in majority will) get unlocked long before you finish the game.

# 4) Dummy Section (conclusion/tips and tricks)
