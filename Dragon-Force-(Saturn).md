## **Introduction**

Dragon Force was one of the most highly rated games on Saturn. It is a strategy-RPG where you select a kingdom and play through a non-linear, unique campaign to unite the other seven monarchs of Legendra and form the Dragon Force. Only then can the dark god Madruk, who is threatening all of mankind, be challenged and defeated. The game features both campaign-level map conquest as you move armies between strategic locations including castles, towns, shrines and towers as well as real time battles opposing forces lead by generals command up to 100 troops each. The game boasts one of the best sound tracks in retro gaming history with almost all of the music being extremely well made.


## **Set Design**

Due to the non-linear design of the game, there is significant variety between play throughs and even more variety between selected kingdoms. In order to provide exposure to the game's full content, it was determined that play throughs of each kingdom, focusing on their unique aspects would be the most appropriate course of action. As such, each kingdom has over 20 kingdom-specific achievements that can only be unlocked during its specific play through and an additional 39 achievements that can be earned while playing as any kingdom.

Each kingdom offers a unique experience and potential for a different approach to the conquest portion of the game. As such, the set was designed to maximize players' exposure to the aspects that differentiate each kingdom. Kingdom-specific achievements are a mix of progression and challenge achievements.


## **Compatibility**

The achievements require the following linked hash:
