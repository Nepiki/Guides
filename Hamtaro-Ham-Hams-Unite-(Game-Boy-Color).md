# 2) Introduction
Hamtaro: Ham-Hams Unite! is a very casual, comfy adventure game. Your goal? Bring the Ham-Hams back to the clubhouse for boss! But they won't listen to you just begging them to go back (well, aside from one), no, you have to help them with their troubles or speak in ham-chat to them before they move an inch. Learning all of the ham-chat is therefore also the end-goal of the game. 

This set has a total of 44 achievements worth 231 points, and was created by [Rewsifer](https://retroachievements.org/user/Rewsifer). A solid set for a solid game, without any missables or tough achievements since you can't really make any tough achievements for an overall easy game like this. It's basically free points :D!

# 3) Walkthrough

[**Step 1: Story Achievements**](#step-1-story-achievements--total-points-108)

All of these achievements are either mandatory for beating the game.

[**Step 2: Ham-Chat Achievements**](#step-2-ham-chat-achievements--total-points-72)

While most of these are naturally earned by beating the game normally, some are completely optional.

[**Step 3: Miscellaneous Achievements**](#step-3-miscellaneous-achievements--total-points-51)

Aside from the ham-chat, there's also some music to collect and rocks to find. Recommended is to keep those for the post-game, because Stars tend to spawn in the same locations as rocks. And every time you re-enter Sky Garden, you have to do the sequence of tugging the plug out for the water to gain access to the middle, and that would be a waste of time.

_Complete the Tutorial._

The tutorial of the game right from the get-go. Pretty straightforward achievement.

_Bring home the Ham-Ham by finding her Shiny Rock._

Bijou is found in Acorn Shrine. She'll tease you right from the next screen of the entrance, and will keep walking away from you until she reaches the screen with the big tree in the top left. **Tack-Q** the tree to get her away from there, then say **Oopsie** to make her happy again. The Shiny Rock is found in the hole right next to the tree by using **Digdig**.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/18172.png) [Maxwell! (10)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/18470)   
_Bring home the Ham-Ham by cheering him up._

Maxwell is found in Acorn Shrine. He is in the area under the shrine with the cracked wall, which you have to use **Tack-Q** on twice to make a spot of light appear. Say **Hamha** at this light spot and Maxwell will fall down. Cheer him up by using **Nopibloo**.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/18139.png) [Oxnard! (10)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/18457)   
_Bring home the Ham-Ham by finding his Special Seed._

Oxnard is found in Sunflower Park. He is very close to the beginning, being all sad that his seed is gone. Say **Hamha** and check the holes with **Digdig** to confirm he has already checked every hole, then say **Chukchuk**.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/18140.png) [Pashmina! (10)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/18458)   
_Bring home the Ham-Ham by finding her Scarf._

Pashmina is found in Sunflower Park. On the far right of the area there are multiple bars to climb up on. Climb up the second pole with **Scroochie** to find Pashmina, whose scarf will blow away. Go down and climb the first pole, then use **Gasp-P** on the crow. Go back up on the second pole and deliver Pashmina her scarf.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/18179.png) [Penelope! (10)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/18476)   
_Bring home the Ham-Ham by making her laugh._

Penelope is found in the Ruins. When you come across the cuckoo clock, **Scroochie** your way up and make your way towards the water pool. Use **Tuggie** on the plug to empty the pool. Go back up and use **Hammo** on the frog with Penelope on top.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/18181.png) [Weather Ham (3)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/18482)   
_Get the Frog-Badge._

This item is found in the Ruins. After having brought Penelope back, the frog will be in front of the defective TV. Use **Bestest** first, then **Hifhif** to obtain the Frog-Badge.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/18227.png) [Cappy! (10)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/18492)   
_Bring home the Ham-Ham by winning the wig._

Cappy is found in the Ruins. After having obtained the Frog-Badge, go all the way to the top of the roof in the far right until you see picknicking hamsters. Use **Hifhif** and then answer with **Pooie** to have them begone, and then enter the hole with **Digdig**. Cappy is down here, but you need to win a wig for him first in Tack-Q Bowling by scoring at least 130 points. Pretty easily done by solely aiming for the blue balloons, as the balloon pattern never changes. After having obtained the wig, use **Ta-Dah** to bring him home.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/18145.png) [Panda! (10)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/18463)   
_Bring home the Ham-Ham by finding him in the school._

Panda is found in Sunflower Elementary. He is on the first floor in the room on the left. Just climb up to him and say **Hamha** to bring him back.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/18182.png) [Back To The Workshop (3)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/18483)   
_Get Panda to fix the Bottle._

This item is found in Sunflower Elementary. In the school entrance, go up the lockers on the left to find a Ham-Swap shop where you can buy it (you can haggle too by using **Blast-T**). Bring this bottle back to Panda in the Clubhouse and say **Wishie** to him.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/18176.png) [HTTP (1)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/18473)   
_Visit Hamtaro.com_

Go to the PC in Sunflower Elementary on the right room on the second floor. Use **Stickie** on the PC tower to turn it on, then walk to the mouse mat. Move the mouse around and click on Hamtaro's face, then click on Hamtaro again to learn **Smoochie**.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/18228.png) [Jingle! (10)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/18493)   
_Bring home the Ham-Ham by sharing advice._

Jingle is found in Sunflower Elementary. He is on the first floor in the room on the right. To reach him, you first have to do a lengthy side-quest involving the bottle. Bring this bottle to the room on the left on the second floor and **Huffpuff** the hamster selling tea. Bring this bottle back to the room on the right on the first floor where a hamster is blocking some stairs, and give it to him. Climb up those stairs to find Jingle, then use **Pooie** first and **Smoochie** second.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/18196.png) [Stan and Sandy! (10)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/18487)   
_Bring home the Ham-Hams by teaming up._

Stan and Sandy are found in Sky Garden. To get up to the pool, you first need to give the monkey bananas obtained for the room on the right on the first floor of Sunflower Elementary, then go to the right and **Scroochie** up the tree. From here, you see Stan interacting with every hamster and then moving a screen. Talk with every hamster as well to learn a ham-chat relevant for the next hamster, and keep following Stan until you reach the sunbathing female hamster. For her, use **Hamha** and then **Hamtast** to get a request to bring her strawberry juice, which is gotten from the screen to the right from the bar by using **Wishie**. Go behind the bar and use **Tuggie** on the plug. Go to where the log is in the water and cross it to find Sandy on a bench. Use **Tuggie** and **Lookie** to get her to move south. Say **Hamteam** to her and then chase Stan around clockwise again until he reaches Sandy.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/18234.png) [Howdy and Dexter! (10)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/18523)   
_Bring home the Ham-Hams by settling the score._

Howdy and Dexter are found in Sunflower Market. After seeing them the first time, go right into the freezer and climb up where you see Dexter and say **Hammo**. Then go to the south-west and climb up the cash register, then **Digdig** near Howdy. Go down and learn than Dexter is in trouble, then go back up and say **Gasp-P** to Howdy. Go with him to the freezer, use **Pakapaka** and learn that you need a heat patch.

This Heat Patch is sold by the Ham-Swap hamster in the market, but first only for 9999 seeds. Say **No-P** twice, then head back to Howdy. Head out of the freezer, help the reporter by getting her bag back by using **Tack-Q** on the Bicycle at the beginning. You get a newsflash that you need to bring to Howdy, then follow him deeper into the store back to the Ham-Swap hamster. Now you can buy the Heat Patch and bring them both home.

**If you decided to go to Howdy first instead of Dexter, you basically have to do the exact same but in reverse, and get a Striped Sticker instead of a Heat Patch.**
