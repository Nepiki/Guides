:no_entry: **\*\* MAY CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS \*\*** :no_entry:

Note that the names of characters, places, etc. used in this guide are based off of the [Chaos Rush translation](https://www.romhacking.net/translations/4760/), which is closest to the official Square Enix translation for FFIII on the Nintendo DS. When possible, I will try to use both names with the Chaos Rush name first followed by the early translation in parentheses.

It will appear like this, as an example:
<br>Gysahl(Gisahl)
