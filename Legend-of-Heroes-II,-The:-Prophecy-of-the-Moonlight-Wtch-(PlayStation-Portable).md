# 2) Introduction

The Legend of Heroes II: Prophecy of the Moonlight Witch is a role-playing game originally developed by [Nihon Falcom Corporation](https://nihon-falcom.fandom.com/wiki/Nihon_Falcom_Corporation). It is the second game in the "Gagharv Trilogy", a trilogy spanning three games with [The Legend of Heroes: A Tear of Vermillion](https://retroachievements.org/game/3562) and [The Legend of Heroes III: Song of the Ocean](https://retroachievements.org/game/3567), and it takes place last chronologically in the timeline. This was originally created as the first game before Bandai decided to screw it up with localization. Out of all three games however, it doesn't matter in which order you play this one, although I would personally recommend at least playing _A Tear of Vermillion_ first. This series is known to be the predecessor to the sixth game in the The Legend of Heroes series, Trails in the Sky, which is now commonly knows as the Trails series.

This achievement set is created by developer [ladynadiad](https://retroachievements.org/user/ladynadiad), who has done an excellent job covering everything the game has to offer. There are a lot of missable achievements in this set that are chronologically ordered on the game page, but I wanted to emphasise on them further by introducing a completely spoiler-free guide. This guide hides all the story achievements in a toggle with the amount described, making it so that this guide can be approached without the worry that you will be spoiling yourself. For example, if the toggle says 2 achievements, then everything between this toggle and the next toggle can be gained in-between that time. If you are a veteran of the series however, you are most likely familiar with how this game handles missables: talking to every NPC after every major happening in the story. By following this approach, most if not all achievements shouldn't be a problem for you! Added to this game are red exclamation marks for important events, so as long as you make sure all of these are dealt with, you should be a-okay.

**Do note: you need a save file of A Tear of Vermillion to master this game. It does NOT need to be a complete save file.**

# 3) Walkthrough

Not entirely sure if you need to have talked to the guard prior to entering the castle, but just to be safe it is recommended to do so. He is standing at the bottom side of the castle screen, and after talking with the king, you can talk with him again to make him perform a handstand.

<big><pre>
[Precise Historian (25)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/221437)
_Complete 100% of the history (must import data from A Tear of Vermillion)_
</pre></big>

As indicated by the achievement, you must import a save file from A Tear of Vermillion, the first Legend of Heroes game on PSP. This save file does NOT need to be complete, so you can simply boot up the game, make a save, and then import it. You can do this at any point of the story, so if you decide to play this game first for whatever reason, just be sure to have a save file before defeating the final boss.

The rest of the history is all obtained by having done every missable achievement. Do be sure to have triggered the history record on the boat in the prologue that does not come with an achievement!!!
