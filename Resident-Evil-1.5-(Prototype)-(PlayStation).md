## Introduction
![Image](https://retroachievements.org/Images/045872.png)
 
Welcome to the achievement guide for [-Prototype- Biohazard 2 | Resident Evil 1.5]( https://retroachievements.org/game/17454)! This guide was made on the fact that the game is highly undocumented and would prove difficult to get all the achievements only by trial and error, let alone progress the story normally. This guide will cover all the achievements currently on the set and if the set gets updated to include more achievements this guide will also be updated. **Guide is still WIP**.

## Achievement Summary
 
There are currently **86 achievements** worth a total of **1085 points**.

 ## Save Support

The game currently lacks any sort of save support so if you die in the game you need to start from the beginning all over again, making these challenges more hard to get than in any other Resident Evil game, this is reflected in their values being double what the would normally be plus the game difficulty is increased due to the amount of hits it takes to kill any enemy so beware.

## Compatibility

Currently this game has 3 unique ROM(s) registered for it with the following RA Checksums:
