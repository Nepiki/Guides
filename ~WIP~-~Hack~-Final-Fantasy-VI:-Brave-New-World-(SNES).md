### <a name="tworun"></a>Two Run Split
This guide is written with the intent on doing two runs after the first Espers are attained in Zozo (everything prior to Zozo can be done together):

The first run utilizes Esper Levels and worries about Character Level restrictions on the achievements. The Esper Levels will more than make up for our Character Level restrictions. I assume heavily you build your characters the way I do because, with the exception of two bosses, we are going to mostly destroy everything in sight with relative ease. Although we are going to do that, some bosses can still give us a run for our money, and so we play defensively and slowly; playing defensively and slowly doesn't make a boss hard, it just means that to absolutely ensure our survival, we drag out the fight a bit longer. I am going to also assume you only reach Esper Level 20 by the end of the game (and will reference in the guide what your Esper Level should be); however, you are most likely going to be near the max of Esper Level 25. In that case, feel free to spend your extra points however you want; more HP/MP is a safe bet as is improving weaker stats. Improving greater stats, based on how I'm building the characters, will give you very diminishing returns, so I don't personally recommend that, but you are free to do as you please.
    
The second run assumes no Esper Levels (although you can equip them in boss battles, and I will assume you do!  Just make sure EXP Gain is turned Off when you engage a boss! You can NOT, however, equip them against the final boss Kefka, nor can anyone you left behind on the ship equip them!). To compensate for weaker stats, we'll need that extra HP/MP from Character Leveling because the strategies will be MOSTLY the same, but the battles will drag on a bit longer.

HOWEVER, the entirety of the World of Balance can be done in ONE RUN. The ultimate boss for the World of Balance, Atma Weapon, will be more difficult, but it is entirely doable by following the setups you'll see below. So you can save yourself some effort. You will, however, likely have about 2-3 fewer Esper Levels at the end-game. This is actually fine; the lack of a few extra points in stats will only play in the entirety of Kefka's Tower, and it will simply drag a few fights on 2-3 rounds longer. The final battle with Kefka will be a bit more demanding, specifically the first two forms of that (more rounds against that part of the gauntlet is not good), but the final two forms are not a big deal.

Unfortunately, the World of Ruin is so disjointed, I do not recommend trying to combine everything in one playthrough. Against Kefka, the finale, you simply won't have enough HP or MP to deal with the first two forms of that nightmare with your low, non-Esper-Level stats. And if you try to do as much as you can in the World of Ruin in one playthrough, you'll reach close to your level caps you won't be able to go grind out enough Esper Levels to get your stats up to par.

We are not trying to play optimally and minmax. We are trying to 100% this very fair set on this very difficult game with as little difficulty as possible. Do as you will.
[Top](#top)
### <a name="clel"></a>Character Levels and Esper Levels
The max Esper Level is 25 and Character Level is 50. They both have the same EXP growth system, and you will find substantial increases in place to deliberately curb grinding. Specifically, going from any 9 to 10 is normal, but then from 10 to 11 is enormous, and then from 11 to 12 is normal.  This repeats again with the 20, 30, and 40 levels. This won't be an issue for us.

Character levels ONLY offer HP/MP growth and then the usual damage increase since level is part of that calculation. Furthermore, everyone always receives the same amount of HP or MP per level up with only the initial/base stat being different. However, with Esper Levels, this becomes character-dependent. Celes, for example, gets the means to improve any of her stats, while Strago is not given a means of improving his Vigor.  It all depends on the Esper the party member can equip.
    
The way Esper Levels work is you equip an Esper (any Esper) and gain some EXP. Eventually, you will gain Esper Levels. You then go pick any Esper the person can equip (the Esper does not actually need to be equipped!) and go down to the bonus at the bottom and select it to spend one (level) point on that stat increase.  You can do this at any time, and I encourage you to read ahead in the guide to see how I ultimately distribute points--I give you three tables of point distributions based on key points in the game to summarize where we are (although I will tell you occasionally to spend more points as we get them).
    
This process is the key to how your character grows and specializes themselves.  For example, you can make Terra a powerful warrior or a powerful mage, or you can make her suck at both. You can make many characters veritable tanks with a lot of HP/MP.  The choice is yours, but you should think about what kind of character you want that character to be. Shadow will never be a powerful mage, for example.

### <a name="change"></a>Notable Changes
As explained above, the Esper and leveling system are the biggest changes, encouraging you to level up at your leisure and not put it off in order to maximize growth because of how the vanilla game worked. 

Another substantial change is that chests no longer "upgrade," so you should loot every chest you see when you see it!

Equipment is also a lot more important, and even older equipment has a lot of value!  We're even going to be using very old equipment for an almost end game boss!  In fact, equipment is often going to give us incredible stat boosts that we'll need and are more than enough to make up for not spending Esper Level points into those stats (as evident by the no-Esper-Level run).
    
Sap and Poison are also more significant, now. Sap is basically recurring damage that's pretty small but is a block to Regen--Sap and Regen undo each other. Poison is the same thing, only Poison does damage more slowly but it gets stronger and stronger each time the damage occurs. Unfortunately, most bosses are immune to Poison, but nearly all of them are susceptible to Sap!  Sap is, however, not very strong in the end game and is mostly there to prevent Regen. Your characters can also be hurt by these.
    
Characters' abilities have changed somewhat drastically.  Cyan's Bushido and Sabin's Blitzes now do different types of damage and many impart status ailments to keep them from being useless once you get new abilities. Gau's Rages have been dropped down to just 64, and they are all diverse and can help tremendously with just going through the field (although only a few will be used against bosses).  Setzer's failed Slot can now be so much more powerful based on his Stamina, basically giving an MP-free Cure2 (or slightly less) to the party!  Not only is Relm's Sketch more useful, we'll actually be making some small use of it against an end-game boss!
    
But perhaps most importantly is the Elements.  Elements are now much, much more important as most bosses go down easily to some, one boss is dependent on having full elemental coverage, and characters have specific elements they can toss out. As usual, the Element chart of what works against what is:  Fire <-> Ice, Bolt <-> Water, Wind <-> Earth, Holy <-> Dark. And Dark is now a real element, with an entirely new spell (called Dark) added, which only one character can learn!  Adding to it, Sap and Poison are also Dark-elemental, and this is important to keep in mind because a few characters can cast these spells, and you'll want to make sure you're paying attention to what's weak to what.

### <a name="advice"></a>Words of Advice
This game is hard. I am going to assume you have already played the vanilla, so I won't be teaching you any of that. There are classrooms in Narshe and Jidoor that will teach you the specifics of what changed in this game.

But to be clear, I am only here to help you get achievements. Most of those are tied to bosses, and we are going to easily get through almost all of them. That means I will tell you how to beat the boss, but I won't tell you how to defeat minor enemies. I will make a few remarks on buying some equipment, and you'll see we don't use that equipment in any boss--this is because that equipment is going to help you get around the world and grind some.
    
Also, money should NEVER be an issue in this game. You can at any point turn off the EXP Gain in the Config menu and go fight for GP.  We're also going to reach our level restrictions (and I'll tell you when), so be prepared for some level grinding...  That extra bit of HP and MP helps a lot more than you think because it means someone survived an attack that would have killed them one level below. That means that person can get off a turn they were waiting on, a turn that might have been trying to revive someone or curing the party or undoing a status ailment or applying a buff or whatever. Less goes a lot more in this hack, and every little bit helps.

### <a name="guidelines"></a>General Guidelines for this Guide
Most of you are here for dealing with bosses. I do, however, assume you build your characters the way I do, and I provide two tables showing endgame stats for World of Balance and World of Ruin based on how I divided points. You can at any point go spend an egregious amount of money to change your stats in the World of Ruin once you get the airship.

Because of the boss issue, there is a separate section detailing all of them, and I will not list them in the walkthrough, which I am putting at the very end with mostly bullet points, important tidbits, and sanity checks, as most of the game outside the bosses hasn't changed much. At the end of EVERY boss, I provide a link to take you to the top of this guide so you can quickly get back to some other part of the guide. In the walkthrough, I provide links to the relevant boss section so you can snap there quickly.

[Top](#top)
### <a name="progression"></a>Progression
There are :LKJL:KJ NON-boss achievements related to progression. I will not list the boss-related ones in this section. Otherwise, they are:

Son of a Submariner - Escape Figaro Castle by defeating the two TekArmors, then discuss your plan with Terra. Unlocks when you regain control of the party after leaving Figaro Castle for the first time.

The Evil That Men Do - Witness Kefka poison Doma, meet Cyan, then pass through the imperial encampment. Unlocks once you leave the Imperial encampment with Cyan in the party.

Hop Aboard - Complete Sabin's scenario by going through the trench, you madman. Unlocks when Sabin's scenario ends.

Easy Escort Mission - Complete Terra's scenario by meeting up with Arvis in Narshe. Unlocks when Terra's scenario ends.

Celes Unchained - Rescule Celes from the Imperial Soldiers in South Figaro. Unlocks when you free Celes and she joins the party.

Nobody Saw That Coming - Get betrayed by the Empire. Unlocks when Kefka attacks Thamasa near the end of World of Balance.

That's it!  All other story-based achievements are tied to bosses, so I'll just put those there!
[Top](#top)
### <a name="missables"></a>Missables
These (non-boss, non-treasure) achievements have specific conditions that you can fail, either by progressing through the game without seeing them or something else. I will note them in the walkthrough at the bottom. I am not going to note the level-restricted achievements as those are tied to bosses. They are:

Blade of Vengeance - Let Cyan cleave the enemies in the Imperial Camp. When Cyan is fighting the three groups of enemies in the imperial encampment shortly before he joins the party, do nothing the whole battle (except Item heal) and let Cyan do all the work. Unlocks after the third battle.

You Know What To Do - Suplex that train. Unlocks after the first Suplex is performed on Phantom Train.

The Trooper - Kill a trooper instead of taking his clothes. After Locke becomes a merchant and needs the trooper outfit, just kill him instead of Stealing his clothes. Unlocks upon battle completion. Head into a building and exit to respawn the trooper.

Rafter Race - Reach Ultros in the opera rafters with at least 2:30 remaining. Incompatible with Exterminator. With my setup, you can afford to fight 3 battles of rats out of 5. Otherwise, you need to be careful--take more time to wait than rush through. Unlocks upon talking to Ultros.

Exterminator - Defeat all the rats in the opera house rafters before time runs out. Incompatible with Rafter Race, you need to kill all 5 groups of rats. Unlocks after the battle ends with the 5th group.

IMPS, The Musical - End the battle vs. Ultros in the Opera House with a party of three imps. Ultros will attempt to turn everyone into Imps via Imp Song, so let it happen. After some time, he will do it again, but this undoes the previous attempt for those it hits. It has a habit of missing. On a no-Esper-level run, you need to go all the way back to the Veldt to teach someone the Imp spell to make sure you can cast it in the battle to have your party of imps. Otherwise, you might have already picked it up. Regardless, this unlocks after the battle has ended.

Well-rounded Headgear - Steal a Stat Hat from an enemy. Just have Locke steal a Stat Hat from an Onion Kid (rare steal). Onion Kids are found in the Magitek Research Facility or on Triangle Island once you can fly there. Unlocks when Locke attempts to steal since the item/success are determined upon the action starting.

Impeccable - Get a perfect score at the Emperor's banquet. Follow the walkthrough below if you're not sure. Unlocks upon choosing Yes to end the banquet and go with the empire to Thamasa.

No Machine Can Stump Me - Check in on Cid and Setzer and hear a bit on Setzer's past. After the banquet, walk all the way southewest to Miranda and enter your airship. Head to the engine room and witness a scene between Cid and Setzer. Unlocks after that scene.

Running Free - Find and defeat a cactuar in the world of balance. Cactuars are found in the northernmost tip of the map near the center, a little bit of land touching the edge of the map northeast of Narshe. Sabin's Pummel or Edgar's Drill will one-shot it.

Man on the Edge - Save Cid's life, so he can appear in future Final Fantasy games. The start of World of Ruin, Brave New World has changed the fish significantly so this is not as annoying or long to do. Unlocks once Cid starts the dialog of him being okay.

Assembly of Heroes - Recruit all characters in the World of Ruin. This is only missable if you left Shadow to die on the Floating Continent (and there is a strategic reason why you might want to do that). Otherwise unlocks when the 14th character has been added to the party.

Hallowed by they Name - Teach the Rerise spell to both Shadow and Relm. This is only missable if you left Shadow to die on the Floating Continent before teaching him Rerise. Otherwise unlocks once both characters have learned it.

We Trust Ramuh's Judgment - Collect all Magicite. Technically missable as you can ignore the Ifrit magicite and ignore the Dragons to not get Ragnarok. Unlocks after the final Esper has been attained.

A Brave New World - Beat the game having earned no esper points and having no espers equipped in the final battle. The purpose for the "two run split." This is basically hard mode, although you are not locked to levels if you already did the level restriction. You can learn spells on the Veldt (and you should!)! but not ONE PERSON, in the party or on the airship, can have an Esper equipped when you go fight Kefka. You can, however, have Espers for all other bosses (turn EXP off). Unlocks upon Kefka's defeat.

### <a name="rages"></a>Rages
There are two achievements tied to Rages. There are 64 total Rages, with 39/64 available in the World of Balance and 25/64 in the World of Ruin, so you can unlock one in each world. I will list here where to find the monsters alphabetically, and the walkthrough will detail where to find monsters as you play the game. Each one unlocks after the requisite numbered Rage has been attained.

The Book of Souls 1 - Obtain 30 different rages for Gau.
Adamantite, Albatross, Antlion, Behemoth, Bomb, Brainpan, Cephalid, Chickenlip, Chimera, Conjurer, Crawler, Doggo, Exocite, Eye Goo, Flan, Gargoyle, Hornet, Jinn, Kudzu, Leafer, Lich, Locust, Ninja, Onion Kid, Rain Man, Raven, Repo Man, Rhydon, Sand Ray, Scrapper, Sewer Rat, Soldier, Spirit, Stray Cat, Tek Armor, Templar, Vaporite, Vulture, Zombone.

Anemone, Belladonna, Buffalax, Griffin, Grizzly, Io, Magic Pot, Mantodea, Marlboro, Mesosaur, Nastidon, Osteosaur, Revenant, Rocky, Scarab, Shokan, Titan, Troll, Tumbleweed, Tyrano, Vagrant, Weedula, Werewolf, Windrunner, Witch.
[Top](#top)
### <a name="lores"></a>Lores
There are twelve Lores, with 7 in the World of Balance and 5 in the World of Ruin. The achievement will unlock after the final Lore has been attained. I will describe the easiest way to learn them.

Blue Magic Master - Learn all twelve lores.

| Lore | Monster | Where/How Found |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Aqualung | None | Start with it |
| Bad Breath | Marlboro | World of Ruin - Daryl's Tomb; Have Gau use this Rage in battle until it is cast |
| Blaze | Heartfire | World of Balance - Thamasa; Heartfire will use it at some point |
| Blowfish | Cactuar | World of Balance - Northeast of Narshe |
| Discord | Jinn | World of Balance - Cave to the Sealed Gate; Have Gau use this Rage in battle until it is cast |
| Holy Wind | Adamantite | World of Balance - Near Thamasa; Have Gau use this Rage in battle until it cast |
| Quasar | Hidon | World of Ruin - Hidon's Cave |
| Raid | Kudzu | World of Balance - Esper Cave near Thamasa; Have Gau use this Rage in battle until it is cast |
| Raze | Atma | World of Balance - Floating Continent; Atma will use it at some point |
| Refract | Troll | World of Ruin - Dinosaur Forest; have Gau use this Rage in battle until it is cast |
| Shield | Hidonite | World of Ruin - Hidon's Cave; Kill all the Hidonites, and they will eventually revive. The leftmost one will use this upon revival |
| Tsunami | Pond Scum | World of Ruin - Cave to the Ancient Castle; get one's HP pretty low |

If you did not learn Raze from Atma Weapon, you can learn it from Shokan in Daryl's Tomb. Gau's Shokan Rage will also teach it. Tsunami is difficult to survive; Pond Scum typically come in groups, and when one uses it, they all use it, and it is very powerful. Be careful.
[Top](#top)
### <a name="steals"></a>Steals
These (UNMISSABLE) achievements are either for Stealing something or require Steal to do. Steal success is based on Speed, so get Locke with equipment to boost that stat. Setzer and Gogo can also steal with KNIFE, but they're less reliable. The missable one with Stat Hat is found in the Missables section.

The Life Knife - Steal a Healing Shive from a Hobo. Hobos are found in Zozo, and this is a rare steal.

It's a Mystery... - Equip a Mystery Egg to Celes. Take Locke to the Phantom Forest and encounter a Wight, the ghost enemy. This is a rare steal. It is also found on Wraith (cave to the sealed gate) or Revenant (Phoenix Cave). Unlocks when Celes has it equipped.

Triple Absorbent - Steal a Multiguard shield from an enemy. Multiguards are found on the enemies that are women smoking long cigarettes. They are Dahling, Madam, and Maiden. They can be found in Owzer's Mansion in the paintings (missable), in Cyan's dream sequence notably on the train and the final castle (missable), or on Kefka's Tower. Take Party 1 and enter the third screen which is the first factory screen for them. This is a rare steal. Unlocks upon steal success.
[Top](#top)
### <a name="misc"></a>Miscellaneous
These are the other (UNMISSABLE) achievements that don't really fit into any category. They're listed in the likely order you can do them in.

Kweh? - Attempt to do a barrel roll while riding a Chocobo. At any time on a Chocobo, hit L or R. Unlocks upon button press.

Correct Twice Per Day - Put in the correct time in Zozo's clock puzzle. In Zozo, the clock puzzle solution hasn't changed, but it's done in Roman numerals. The solution is VI:II:X. Unlocks when the seconds have been put in.

Murasame - Obtain the Murasame katana. After the banquet and can fly again, head to Doma Castle, up the stairs to the exit door south of Cyan's room. Follow the path to the first door in the southeast corner that leads to a treasure room, and one of the treasures contains this sword. Unlocks upon opening the chest.

Can I Play With Madness - Obtain the Schematics from Julian. After Figaro Castle resurfaces in the World of Ruin and Edgar joins the party, head to the eastern tower where you took Terra near the beginning of the game and head upstairs. The guard there is Julian, so talk to him. Unlocks after the dialog ends.

I'm a God Why Can't I Live on - Defeat a Powerslave. Powerslaves are found in Daryl's Tomb, commonly in the first room. Fairly easy enemies. Unlocks upon one dying.

Don't be a Square - Find Daryl's Soul. This is the tombstone puzzle in Daryl's Tomb, only the word now spells ENIX. Unlocks after you put in the word ENIX.

Very Spirited - Obtain Leo's Crest. After you get your airship, head to South Figaro and go to the merchant with the cider (downstairs in the Cafe). Talk to him and you'll get Leo's Spirits. Take these to Thamasa with Celes in the party, head to the east to Leo's grave, talk to it, and the scene will unlock. Unlocks after the scene ends.

The Edge of Darkness - Forge either the Apocalypse or Illumina. Get Locke in the World of Ruin from the Phoenix Cave and head to Narshe to the BUILDING. Go down the stairs inside and talk to the man and pick your weapon. Unlocks after the dialog ends.

The Blitzkrieg - Perform all eight blitzes in one battle. Take Sabin and others to the Dinosaur Forest east of Narshe and north of the Cave of the Veldt and enter a battle against some Trolls and a Brontosaur. Everyone else keeps Sabin alive while he works on Blitzes one by one. Start with your multi-target (Sonic Boom, Fire Dance), then the healing (Mantra, Chakra), then the single-target (Aura Bolt, Suplex, Pummel, Bum Rush) ones. Unlocks after the eigtht unique Blitz has been performed. This battle is chosen because enemies are likely to survive all of them.
[Top](#top)
### <a name="bosses"></a>Bosses
No strategies here, only the list in order (mostly) with level restrictions where applicable. Strategies are the next section! All unlock upon death of the final enemy/boss in the battle. With the exception of the final battle with Kefka and the Lethe River battle against Ultros, the ONLY level checks are those in the active party. Lethe River ignores Banon because Banon joins at the average +2. Kefka's battle checks all 14 playable characters, including those left on the airship.

Biggs' Briefing - Defeat the Whelk in the Narshe cavern.

Moogles to the Rescue - Defeat the Captain (and both wolves) in the Narshe Caves to protect Terra.

Blood Brothers - Have Sabin pummel Vargas into next week.

Don't Tease the Octopus, Kids - Defeat Ultros on the Lete Riverthen continue your raft ride. (Max level of Terra, Edgar, and Sabin is level 10. Banon can be whatever level).

No Souls For You - Defeat the Phantom Train with all party members alive at the end of battle (my strategy will guarantee this).

# 4. <a name="strats"></a>Boss Strategies
For every fight, I will first provide a "loadout" that looks like this:
| Name | Right Hand | Left Hand | Head | Body | Relic | Relic | Esper |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Then I will provide detailed strategies.  For this section, I am NOT providing stats as those are found in the walkthrough.

I will also be dividing each boss (starting with Ultros (Opera) because there are no Espers prior to him) into two sections, one for the Esper-level run and one for the non-Esper-level run, including two loadouts because strategies change when we can't exploit Espers.

### <a name="whelk"></a>
| Name | Right Hand | Left Hand | Head | Body | Relic | Relic | Esper |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Terra | Mythril Bolo | Buckler | Leather Hat | Hard Leather | None | None | N/A |
| Wedge | Mythril Bolo | Buckler | Leather Hat | Hard Leather | Dirty Undies | Nonea | N/A |
| Biggs | Mythril Bolo | Buckler | Leather Hat | Hard Leather | None | None | N/A |

Three Tek Lasers (one from each) or two from Terra alone will end this. Much easier than the original. Still don't hit the shell; you won't ever do enough damage to survive that route.

### <a name="capt"></a>Narshe Captain
| Name | Right Hand | Left Hand | Head | Body | Relic | Relic | Esper |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mog | Mythril Pike | Buckler | None | None | None | None | N/A |

| Kutan | Trident | Buckler | None | None | None | None | N/A |
| Kupan | Boomerang | Buckler | None | None | None | None | N/A |

Mog should use Dusk Requiem and everyone else attack, and Narshe Captain will fall quickly. Even Moogles near death won't change the battle; even if Mog dies, the team is absurdly strong.

### <a name="tek"></a>TekArmors
| Name | Right Hand | Left Hand | Head | Body | Relic | Relic | Esper |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Terra | Mythril Bolo | Buckler | Leather Hat | Hard Leather | None | None | N/A |
| Locke | Mythril Dirk | Mythril Dirk | Bandana | Hard Leather | None | None | N/A |
| Edgar | Mythril Pike | None | Leather Hat | Hard Leather | None | None | N/A |

Terra is Backrow. Terra can single-target Fire, Locke can attack (or use items if needed), and Edgar should use Autocrossbow. They are immune to Noiseblaster this time, and Locke should not try to Steal at all. The last "easy boss" that's guaranteed easy no matter what tactics you really use.

### <a name="vargas"></a>Vargas
| Name | Right Hand | Left Hand | Head | Body | Relic | Relic | Esper |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Edgar | Stout Spear | None | Bandana | Hard Leather | Knight Cape | Dragoon Seal | N/A |
| Locke | Butterfly | Boomerang | Bandana | Karate Gi | Goggles | * | N/A |
| Terra | Iron Cutlass | Heavy Shield | Hair Band | Cotton Robe | Bracelet | * | N/A |

Everyone is Backrow.  Locke and Terra can equip whatever extra Relic you have on hand, or you can leave it blank, it won't matter.

Terra should first use Imp on each of the bears and then use single-target Fire for the rest of the battle, including against Vargas. Locke may get one free attack at the start of the battle but is then on Item healing duty. Edgar should first try to use Noiseblaster at the start of the battle and then use Autocrossbow until both bears are dead. Against Vargas, Edgar should Jump.

Gale Cut is your only real threat, and Terra may stop using Fire to help Locke with items (Edgar should never stop doing damage). Once Sabin arrives, use Pummel to end the battle.

### <a name="letheultros"></a>Ultros (Lethe River)
| Name | Right Hand | Left Hand | Head | Body | Relic | Relic | Esper |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Edgar | Stout Spear | None | Bandana | Hard Leather | Knight Cape | Dragoon Seal | N/A |
| Terra | Iron Cutlass | Iron Shield | Hair Band | Cotton Robe | Fairy Charm | Goggles | N/A |
| Sabin | Mythril Claw | Mythril Claw | Bandana | Karate Gi | Goggles | Bracelet | N/A |
| Banon | Thunder Rod | None | Leather Hat | Cotton Robe | Codpiece | Talisman | N/A |

Everyone is Backrow except Sabin. Banon should only use Health. Sabin should use Pummel to inflict Sap and then use Suplex (which only does 70 more damage, but every little bit helps!). Edgar should Jump, and Terra should spam Fire2 until she runs out of MP, then she can restore her MP and go back to it. As needed, Sabin and then Terra should stop their efforts and use Items for healing to help Banon or get Terra's MP back up.
[Top](#top)
### <a name="hellangel"></a>Hell Angel (Locke's Scenario)
| Name | Right Hand | Left Hand | Head | Body | Relic | Relic | Esper |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Celes | Iron Cutlass | Iron Shield | Hair Band | Iron Armor | Knight Cape | Knight Cape | N/A |
| Locke | Boomerang | Boomerang | Bandana | Karate Gi | Bracelet | Goggles | N/A |

Both are Backrow. Celes should do nothing but Runic, but be careful with the timing as Hell Angel is faster than Celes, so find a rhythm and let her turn pause for a bit if necessary. Locke will either attack or use items to heal people; your only real threats are Tek Laser (which ignores Runic) and Sleep. Drill Gun is not a threat as long as everyone's HP is high. If Celes is put to Sleep for some reason, Locke should immediately wake her up. If Locke is put to Sleep, just wait for the Unicorn to appear to wake him up; Celes should never do anything except Runic. Depending on the boss's attitude, this could be a long or short fight, but it is still simple.

### <a name="train"></a>Phantom Train (Sabin's Scenario)
| Name | Right Hand | Left Hand | Head | Body | Relic | Relic | Esper |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sabin | Spirit Claw | Spirit Claw | Bandana | Karate Gi | Fairy Charm | Goggles | N/A |
| Shadow | Hanzo | Tanto | Bandana | Karate Gi | Goggles | Bracelet | N/A |
| Cyan | Hanzo | None | Bandana | Iron Armor | Black Belt | Knight Cape | N/A |

Cyan should use Mindblow three times, ending the battle. Shadow and Locke should do nothing except recover status ailments and heal with items. Easy fight.

### <a name="kefkanarshe"></a>Kefka (Narshe)
| Name | Right Hand | Left Hand | Head | Body | Relic | Relic | Esper |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gau | None | Buckler | Bandana | Karate Gi | Fairy Charm | Talisman | N/A |
| Sabin | Poison Claw | Poison Claw | Bandana | Karate Gi | Talisman | Life Bell | N/A |
| Edgar | Stout Spear | None | Iron Helm | Iron Armor | Power Glove | Dragoon Seal | N/A |
| Cyan | Kotetsu | None | Iron Helm | Iron Armor | Black Belt | Knight Cape | N/A |
| Celes | Iron Cutlass | Iron Shield | Hair Band | Cotton Robe | Sprint Shoes | Magic Cube | N/A |
| Locke | Butterfly | Boomerang | Bandana | Karate Gi | Barrier Cube | Talisman | N/A |
| Terra | Iron Cutlass | Iron Shield | Hair Band | Cotton Robe | Bracelet | Bracelet | N/A |

Everyone is Backrow except Cyan and Sabin. You are free to pick your favorite combination with the above equipment setup. However, the easiest time I found was the following two parties:
Party 1: Edgar, Celes, Gau, Sabin.
Party 2: Terra, Locke, Cyan.

Party 2 will stay near Banon while Party 1 goes after Kefka. However you set yours up, I will describe what everyone should be doing in battle.

For the standard enemies, Gau can use Albatross Rage while Edgar uses Autocrossbow. Sabin can Suplex (especially Heavy Armor), Cyan can Dispatch, and everyone else can just attack.

Thanatos has 3,000 HP. Edgar should Jump, Celes/Locke/Terra should heal or attack, Sabin should Pummel once to put on Sap and then Suplex, Gau can do anything, Cyan can Mindblow (two of these ends the battle!).

Against Kefka, if you bring Locke, have Locke Steal. If Locke steals the Tiara, the battle ends immediately with your victory!  Otherwise...

Against Kefka, have Sabin use Pummel once to inflict Sap and then Suplex. Gau should use Exocite Rage. Edgar should Jump. Celes should use Runic. Terra and Locke should use Item heal (if Celes is in party; if not, Terra can use Magic). Cyan should use Dispatch.

No matter your party, Celes, Locke, and Terra are the only ones "fragile," but Kefka is easy.

### <a name="dadaluma"></a>Dadaluma
| Name | Right Hand | Left Hand | Head | Body | Relic | Relic | Esper |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sabin | Poison Claw | Poison Claw | Green Beret | Cotton Robe | Stat Stick | Knight Cape | N/A |
| Gau | None | Targe | Bandana | Ninja Gear | Magic Cube | Sprint Shoes | N/A |
| Edgar | Stout Spear | None | Iron Helm | Iron Armor | Power Glove | Dragoon Seal | N/A |
| Cyan | Kotetsu | None | Iron Helm | Iron Armor | Black Belt | Knight Cape | N/A |

Gau and Edgar are Backrow. Sabin should Pummel once to inflict Sap and then attack, healing as needed. Gau should use Sewer Rat Rage; Poison will do over 1,000 damage! Cyan should use Dispatch, which also does over 1,000 damage! Edgar should heal or Jump as needed, in that order.

Sabin and Gau will be the primary damage dealers here. Cyan is good until Dadaluma summons two enemies to help him, and then his Dispatch is unreliable against Dadaluma specifically, but it will still one-shot his friends. Gau's Poison, even if it's multi-target, which also one-shot the enemies, and so will a normal attack from Sabin.

Eventually, Dadaluma will use a Red Bull on himself and Jump, and you should use this time to heal up as needed, but Dadaluma WILL one-shot whoever he lands on. This is no big deal; just restore the condition and heal up; Gau is the only one uncontrollable and does a lot of damage by himself, so the others can break to heal during this time.
[Top](#top)
### <a name="operaultros"></a>Ultros (Opera)
| Name | Right Hand | Left Hand | Head | Body | Relic | Relic | Esper |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sabin | Hell Claw | Poison Claw | Green Beret | Ninja Gear | Black Belt | Power Glove | None |
| Locke | Switch Blade | Targe | Green Beret | Ninja Gear | Thief Glove | Stat Stick | None |
| Gau | None | Targe | Bandana | Ninja Gear | Magic Cube | Sprint Shoes | None |

Everyone is Backrow except Sabin. This setup is actually designed to help you get another achievement requiring you end the fight as Imp, as we could easily make our characters more powerful and kill Ultros so fast he won't have time. If you are not looking for the other achievement, ANY equipment you have that provides better Vigor for Sabin, better Magic for Locke, and better anything for Gau, feel free to equip.

Sabin needs to use Pummel once to inflict Sap and then just attack. Gau should use Albatross Rage. Locke gets two casts of Bolt2 and is then on healing duty until people are hit with Imp, and then remains if you are going for that achievement or recovers people otherwise. IF IMP SONG DOES NOT HIT EVERYONE, have Sabin fix this by casting Imp on those who need it. The achievement does not require Ultros succeed with it, after all! But when Ultros does use Imp Song (about 4-5 rounds), he's almost dead, so keep at it.

### <a name="esper"></a>Ifrit and Shiva
| Name | Right Hand | Left Hand | Head | Body | Relic | Relic | Esper |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sabin | Ocean Claw | Ocean Claw | Tiger Mask | Cotton Robe | Black Belt | Power Glove | None |
| Gau | None | Targe | Tiger Mask | Ninja Gear | Magic Cube | Sprint Shoes | Stray |
| Locke | Icebrand | Scimitar | Bandana | Ninja Gear | Thief Glove | Zephyr Cape | None|
| Celes | Flametongue | Gold Shield | Mystery Veil | White Dress | White Cape | Spirit Stone | None |

Gau is Backrow. Celes and Locke are finally in the front row! This is a very easy fight and we are going to focus only on Ifrit, who will die in a few rounds!

Gau should use Onion Kid Rage, Celes should use Ice, Sabin should attack, and Locke can either attack (if opportunity presents itself) or heal with items (more important). The speed of this battle is dependent on Gau; if Gau gets in a Brown Note, the battle ends in 3-4 rounds. Otherwise, it drags on for another 2-3. And we focus on Ifrit because Sabin does more damage with his attacks with this setup than he does with a Hell Claw and some other weapon against Shiva.

### <a name="024"></a>Number 024
| Name | Right Hand | Left Hand | Head | Body | Relic | Relic | Esper |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sabin | Poison Claw | Poison Claw | Tiger Mask | Cotton Robe | Black Belt | Power Glove | None |
| Gau | None | Targe | Tiger Mask | Ninja Gear | Magic Cube | Sprint Shoes | Stray |
| Locke | Switchblade | Scimitar | Bandana | Ninja Gear | Thief Glove | Zephyr Cape | Ifrit |
| Celes | Scimitar | Gold Shield | Mystery Veil | White Dress | White Cape | Spirit Stone | Shiva |

Everyone is Backrow except Sabin.

Don't waste any time with elemental shenanigans. Have Gau use Onion Knight Rage, Celes uses Runic nonstop, and Sabin and Locke just go on healing duty to keep everyone alive with items. If Gau gets off several Brown Notes, the battle ends a lot faster; if not, you're never in any real danager, but the battle takes longer. If someone is hit with Berserk, use a Green Cherry on them.

### <a name="128"></a>Number 128
| Name | Right Hand | Left Hand | Head | Body | Relic | Relic | Esper |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sabin | Ocean Claw | Ocean Claw | Tiger Mask | Cotton Robe | Black Belt | Power Glove | None |
| Gau | None | Targe | Tiger Mask | Ninja Gear | Magic Cube | Sprint Shoes | Stray |
| Locke | Switchblade | Scimitar | Bandana | Ninja Gear | Thief Glove | Zephyr Cape | Ramuh |

Everyone is Backrow except Sabin. Sabin needs to attack and Gau should use Rain Man Rage, which will destroy 128 (and the Mag Roaders prior to the fight!). Eventually, the claws will die and 128 will put Regen on himself; don't worry, as Sabin does more damage than 128 can heal. Locke is just on healing duty (magic or items; have him summon Ramuh at the start for amazing damage!), but if you feel an opportunity (such as the start of battle), go ahead with a Bolt/Bolt2 if you learned it.

### <a name="cranes"></a>Cranes
| Name | Right Hand | Left Hand | Head | Body | Relic | Relic | Esper |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sabin | Ocean Claw | Ocean Claw | Tiger Mask | Cotton Robe | Black Belt | Power Glove | None |
| Gau | None | Targe | Tiger Mask | Ninja Gear | Magic Cube | Sprint Shoes | Stray |
| Locke | Switchblade | Scimitar | Bandana | Ninja Gear | Thief Glove | Zephyr Cape | Ramuh |
| Setzer | Darts | Targe | Bandana | Mythril Vest | None | None | None |

Gau should use Rain Man Rage and Sabin should attack. Setzer and Locke are on healing duty (have Locke summon Ramuh!), with Setzer making failed Slots to do that. With this setup, the Cranes will fall quickly, but there's a catch! Each has 5,000 HP, and if you take too long to kill both, the remaining one will revive the other at 2,500 HP. As Gau is uncontrollable, have Sabin wait a second and be ready to hit the one Gau does not hit. If you still need to spread some damage, have Locke throw a Bolt/Bolt2 if you learned it.

### <a name="heartfire"></a>Heartfire
| Name | Right Hand | Left Hand | Head | Body | Relic | Relic | Esper |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Terra | Icebrand | Scimitar | Mystery Veil | White Dress | Zephyr Cape | Magic Cube | Bismark |
| Locke | Demonsbane | Icebrand | Stat Hat | Ninja Gear | Thief Glove | Spirit Stone | Ifrit |
| Strago | Ice Rod | Targe | Magus Hat | Cotton Robe | Fairy Charm | Amulet | None |

Terra is Backrow. Terra should cast Storm and Strago should cast Aqualung. Locke's priority is to undo Mute on anyone whenever they get it and then heal (magic or items), but if there is an opportunity, have him attack.

Occasionally, someone may die. If Locke is dead, use Strago to bring him back (Terra does more damage). If not Locke, have Locke cast Life. Feel free at any point to have Terra summon Bismark, too, for more damage than Storm does!
[Top](#top)
### <a name="caveultros"></a>Ultros (Esper Cave)
| Name | Right Hand | Left Hand | Head | Body | Relic | Relic | Esper |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Terra | Flametongue | Scimitar | Mystery Veil | Gold Armor | Zephyr Cape | Magic Cube | Bismark |
| Locke | Flametongue | Scimitar | Stat Hat | Ninja Gear | White Cape | Stat Stick | Ifrit |
| Strago | Fire Rod | Targe | Magus Hat | Gator Hide | White Cape | Amulet | Carbunkl |

Everyone is Backrow. Locke should immediately open with summoning Ifrit and then is on healing duty (magic or items). Terra should use Fire2 and Strago should cast Blaze (if he has it, which he most assuredly does. If for some reason he does NOT, however, Strago is now on healing duty and Locke can use Fire2). If there is an opening, Locke can use Fire2.

As soon as Relm joins, her Sketch will end the fight. However, Ultros can one-shot Terra with a Tentacle at any time, and then when he uses Tentacle, he follows up immediately with El Nino, so you have to decide if you want to revive Terra (if she's dead) or heal the party; ALWAYS revive Terra (preferably with Life as that'll give her some HP). Locke is likely going to be spending the battle using party-wide Cure2 or Life on Terra, and that's okay; if he starts getting low on MP, Strago should be able to use 1-2 more Blazes to trigger Relm's appearance.

If Strago did not have Blaze, you're in a tougher situation. Ultros goes down a lot faster, actually, but Strago is now juggling item healing and MP restore for Locke. Have Locke stop doing damage to help out with healing if necessary; the setup is still fine and will work, but the battle will be much longer.

### <a name="float"></a>Ultros, Chupon, Imperial Air Force
| Name | Right Hand | Left Hand | Head | Body | Relic | Relic | Esper |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gau | Club | Targe | Tiger Mask | Gator Hide | Zephyr Cape | Amulet | Stray |
| Sabin | Ocean Claw | Ocean Claw | Tiger Mask | Ninja Gear | LIfe Bell | Power Glove | Golem |
| Strago | Thunder Rod | Targe | Magus Hat | Tabby Hide | Stat Stick | Magic Cube | Carbunkl |

Everyone is Backrow except Sabin.

Against the Sky Armor/Spitfire fights: have Gau use Rain Man Rage, Strago uses Aqualung, and Sabin should attack or heal as necessary. These all go down very quickly. BEFORE ULTROS, have Sabin switch his claws for one Hell Claw and one Poison Claw!

Against Ultros/Chupon: Sabin should use Pummel on Ultros once to inflict Sap and then attack. Gau should use Conjurer Rage. Strago should use Blaze. If people run out of MP, Strago then Sabin (in order of preference) should fix this. With this setup, after 2 rounds plus one more attack by Sabin, Chupon arrives. Immediately have Sabin summon Golem and then switch his claws for two Ocean Claws (taking half a turn each). This is important for the next fight as, for this fight, Sabin is now going to Pummel only because it does more damage than his claws. Strago should either use Blowfish to attack or Holy Wind to heal. If anyone dies at any point, stop attacking and spend a minute to bring that character up to full health; if they had Rerise, don't bother as they'll have enough HP to keep fighting. Ultros's Tentacle is the only scary part of this fight, so make sure to heal after!

Against Imperial Air Force: Gau should use Rain Man Rage. Sabin should attack the main body. Strago should use Holy Wind to heal. If Gau should ever die, bring him back and put him on Conjurer Rage. Do not worry about the extra parts on IAF; Gau's Acid Rain will put Sap on everything, and they'll eventually die. Holy Wind is based on Strago's current HP, so feel free to use an item on himself to make Holy Wind more powerful in the next turn as needed. However, your primary focus is keeping Gau alive; Rain Man does both Bolt and Water damage depending on his attack, and IAF is weak to both!

### <a name="atma"></a>Atma Weapon
| Name | Right Hand | Left Hand | Head | Body | Relic | Relic | Esper |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Strago | Ice Rod | Targe | Magus Hat | Tabby Hide | Magic Cube | White Cape | Carbunkl |
| Gau | Club | Targe | Tiger Mask | Gator Hide | Zephyr Cape | Sprint Shoes | Stray |
| Celes | Icebrand | Gold Shield | Mystery Veil | White Dress | Hero Ring | White Cape | Seraph |
| Shadow | Murasame | Sakura | Ninja Mask | Ninja Gear | Wall Ring | Black Belt | Phantom |

Everyone is Backrow except Celes. Everyone has Float before battle! This is considered one of the most difficult battles, and we're going to annihilate him with relative ease.

First, everyone should summon their Espers EXCEPT Shadow, who will summon his but will summon his last. You don't want to still need to get summons in and have Vanish cancel out.

All Espers summoned, Celes's next turn is to use Slow on Atma. Shadow is going to put Haste on Strago and then Celes, in that order. After that, he is going to throw any Ninja Stars (not Shurikens; we're not saving things for the end-game with Shadow). Once the Ninja Stars are gone, Shadow is going to heal with items with the following preference: undoing people's status ailments, Celes's MP, Gau's HP, and then anyone else's HP. If there is a breather, he can restore his own MP and then Haste himself!

Celes has two goals which are done at your own whim based on what you think is needed: party-wide Cure2 and Ice2/Attack. With this setup, Icebrand will cast Ice2 more often, but it is still random, and while it will do more damage if it does cast Ice2 than casting the actual spell, using the spell Ice2 is more consistent. The downside to the spell is the MP cost; more Ice2 means less Cure2. That's why it's up to you.

Strago should only ever cast Ice2, and Gau is on Stray Cat Rage (not Conjurer; with this setup, the initial Rerise from Seraph should be all you need). Atma is extremely weak to Ice.

At some point, Atma is going to "power up," and you'll see prompts on the screen telling you exactly this. Whosever turn comes first, Celes or Shadow immediately need to cast Dispel, and then Celes needs to put Slow back on Atma. It might seem logical to just have Shadow use Dispel so Celes can then use Slow, but Dispel is a HIGH priority when Atma powers up, so it's first come!

Shortly after Atma powers up for the first time, he will cast Flare Star, which will hurt everyone. As long as you're near full health, you won't die, though, and then Celes needs to heal people up with Shadow restoring her MP.

This will be a tense 60,000 HP march, but it is not hard with this setup. At some point, though, Gau may die, and your next actions are dependent on when you are in the battle. If Atma has already used Flare Star (or if Flare Star was what killed Gau), you can leave Gau dead; Atma will be dead soon. If Gau was killed before, everyone needs to stop what they're doing and get Gau back up and at full health, and you have to treat this battle as a soft restart.

If Strago ever dies, no matter what, everyone is now getting him back up and to full health. If Celes dies, do the same, but don't be so aggressive about it; play more defensively (Shadow can bring her back while Strago switches to Holy Wind to keep people alive).  If Shadow dies, don't worry about it.

Celes is Backrow. Everyone has Float before battle! Sabin should Pummel once to inflict Sap and then attack. Celes should put Haste on Sabin and then put Berserk on him. Otherwise, Celes can heal; Phunbaba will flee very shortly with Sabin's offense.

| Celes | Falchion | Diamond Kite | Mystery Veil | Diamond Mail | Guard Ring | Zephyr Cape | Seraph |

Celes is Backrow. Celes should first put Haste on Sabin and then use Bolt2 on the bottom right Tentacle. Sabin should attack the bottom left Tentacle. Edgar can just Bio Blast and heal as needed.

Once the bottom two are dead, Sabin can attack the top left Tentacle, and Celes can help with Ice2. For the final Tentacle, Sabin can just Pummel it to death and Edgar can use Drill, or feel free to spend time switching out Sabin's claws for two Hell Claws (unnecessary; Pummel + Drill will end it shortly) and just attack. Celes can do whatever is needed: attack, heal, item, etc.

| Celes | Falchion | Diamond Kite | Mystery Veil | Diamond Mail | Ribbon | Sprint Shoes | Seraph |

Everyone except Sabin is Backrow. Sabin should attack and Celes should put Haste on him. Setzer can do failed Slots for good healing, and Edgar should Jump (be careful with the timing!). Depending on how much damage you're doing, there's a high chance you will kill him before he hides; if he hides, you'll finish him shortly after he comes out.

Everyone is Backrow. Dullahan has 60,000 HP, same as Atma, and you're not much stronger than you were with Atma, even with newer equipment. Worse, you didn't get to choose your party. There are two methods you can use. There's the slightly more dangerous but more consistent approach by killing Dullahan's MP, or there's the expensive and inconsistent approach by killing his HP. We'll discuss both. However, if you're doing no-Esper-Level, you should more seriously consider the HP approach.

MP:
Dullahan is Undead, and that's why Edgar has a sword and a shield. Unfortunately, Dullahan has 5,000 MP, and only two characters can do damage to it: Celes and Edgar, both with Rasp, which can also miss.

Sabin needs to keep getting Slow on Dullahan and use Mantra as needed. Setzer should be using party-wide Cure2. Occasionally, either will need to use items to undo things. Edgar must survive approximately 620 points of damage from Dullahan's S. Cross attack, so bear that in mind; everyone else can tank through it.

Edgar and Celes are going to use Rasp until Dullahan dies.  With Sabin and Setzer doing party-wide healing, you should be good to go; Setzer can substitute a failed Slot for Cure2 as needed.

HP:
You need Bouncy Balls bought from Figaro Castle. About 30 of them will do, maybe more to be safe. Assign one person as healing and that's all they do and they always do it (Setzer's a good option with failed Slots; feel free to modify his equipment to maximize his Stamina which will improve his healing). Feel free to have Celes go ahead and put Haste on those who don't have it. Otherwise, the three non-healers are throwing Bouncy Balls until victory.

| Edgar | Partisan | None | Dragon Helm | Crystal Mail | Dragoon Seal | Hero Ring | Palidor |
| Sabin | Frostgore | Spirit Claw | Tiger Mask | Dark Gear | Black Belt | Power Glove | Golem |

Everyone is Backrow. Terra should put Slow on Intangir and then Regen on Sabin, then on Edgar, then on Gau, then on herself. After, she's on healing duty and fixing her own MP. Edgar should Jump, Sabin should attack, and Gau should use Stray Cat Rage. If there are issues with curing and MP with Terra, have Edgar stop Jumping to help with healing/MP restoration, then get him back in the air.

Intangir isn't bad. Intangir-Z, however, likes to retaliate every physical attack. Gau is still on Stray Cat Rage. Edgar should prioritize helping Terra heal to give her a chance to use Fire3 once in a while, and rarely (I only got it once!) a Jump. Sabin continues with attacking. At some point early in the fight, Terra should put Slow on Intangir-Z, but try to have her use Fire3 as often as possible while still prioritizing healing since Edgar's heal isn't super great.

| Celes | Falchion | Diamond Kite | Mystery Veil | Crystal Mail | Zephyr Cape | Sprint Shoes | Carbunkl |
| Setzer | Tarot | Diamond Kite | Genji Helm | Crystal Mail | Zephyr Cape | Daryl's Soul | Shoat |

Everyone except Sabin is Backrow. Everyone has Float before battle! Celes should put Haste on Sabin, Edgar should put Berserk on Sabin, and Setzer should put Regen on Sabin. Then, whoever comes first, Setzer or Celes should put Regen on Edgar, who will now Jump; the other of Setzer or Celes should put Haste on Setzer. Setzer's third turn will be to put Sap on Phunbaba, and Celes's third turn can summon Seraph. If anyone dies, make sure to heal them with a Red Bull to give them Float again.

No matter who winds up getting blown away when Phunbaba does it, whether 1 or 2 people, Terra will arrive already in Morph and Backrow status and has Fire3. Three or four of these will end Phunbaba, so that's all she should do while everyone else keeps her alive (even if they die).

| Edgar | Flametongue | Gold Shield | Dragon Helm | Diamond Mail | Hero Ring | White Cape | Palidor |
| Celes | Rune Blade | Gold Shield | Genji Helm | Diamond Mail | Stat Stick | White Cape | Seraph |

Everyone is Backrow. Terra is going to tank through most every magical attack from Chadarnook. Chadarnook's demon form is Undead, and so we are going to drain his MP. However, before ANY offense begins, we are going to prioritize buffing. Terra should be getting Shell on people, Setzer and Celes can Rerise (or just have Celes summon Seraph), and Edgar can use Cure2 as needed. If anyone dies during this stage, pause for a moment to bring that person back up to full health + Shell + Rerise.  

Throughout the battle, occasionally, the girl form of Chadarnook will use SlowX or SleepX; fix this with Remedy, but keep Celes and Edgar primed. Everyone buffed, Edgar and Celes should be using Rasp on the demon form while Setzer and Terra keep the party alive. This is a very easy but long battle with this approach, so just play patiently.

Why not Cyan, who can do more (and more consistent) MP damage? Unfortunately, Cyan's equipment makes him a hassle as he needs constant healing, and our goal is safety.

| Mog | Fire Rod | Flameguard | Red Cap | Diamond Mail | Moogle Charm | Life Bell | Shoat |
| Edgar | Fire Lance | None | Dragon Helm | Diamond Mail | Dragoon Seal | Hero Ring | Palidor |

Everyone is Backrow. Terra has one purpose: Morph and then use Fire3. She'll eventually need MP recovery; someone else needs to handle this because she should never stop. Sabin should keep casting Slow on Tritoch until it sticks, and then he can use Fire Dance Blitz until he dies. Mog should spam Wind Aria and hope he doesn't trip too often; sometimes he heals, sometimes he attacks, and regardless, he does decently! Edgar should use Drill once to set Sap and them use Cure2 on the party nonstop to keep everyone as alive and healthy as possible. He may die; this is fine.

Your priority is keeping Terra alive who will consistently do near max damage against Tritoch's 50,000 HP. Likely, the Figaro brothers WILL die, but by the time they are both dead, Tritoch is nearly dead as you only need 5 full rounds at most to end this.

| Edgar | Fire Lance | None | Dragon Helm | Power Armor | Dragoon Seal | Hero Ring | Palidor |
| Shadow | Sakura | Kagenui | Dark Hood | Diamond Vest | Sprint Shoes | Life Bell | Phantom |

Everyone is Backrow. Terra will never survive a Tackle even with Safe but will survive everything else at near full health. Your first priority is buffing the party. Edgar needs Regen and everyone needs Rerise (have Setzer summon Seraph). Terra and Setzer need Haste, and Edgar should be putting Safe on everyone. Whatever it takes to make everyone have all these stats, do it, and if people die, bring them back up and reapply buffs. Do not worry about hurting Yeti yet, but feel free to put Sap (from Setzer, maybe his first turn) and Slow on him.

Once EVERYONE has Safe/Regen/Rerise/Haste, and Yeti has already cast a Blizzard, have Shadow summon Phantom, and now the battle begins.

Shadow should throw Fire Scrolls if you have any; otherwise, he uses items for healing. Edgar should Jump (and hopefully he's in the air to dodge any Blizzard from Yeti). Terra should use Fire3 nonstop, and Setzer can cast Poison for good damage. There is nothing Yeti can do to anyone until he casts Blizzard, and if you were patient and waited things out, you can tear through most of his 80,000 HP.

Shadow and Setzer may ultimately die. Feel free to try and bring one back, but if Terra or Edgar start losing health, those two are your priorities as they combined do over 10,000 HP damage.

| Celes | * | Crystal Kite | Oath Veil | Genji Armor | Hero Ring | Life Bell | Alexandr |

Gau is the only one who needs to be in Backrow, but it won't hurt Setzer either. Terra/Celes can have Apocalypse/Illumina depending on what you took in Narshe; give the other a Soul Sabre.

Before anything else, have Setzer cast Poison to inflict it and watch more and more damage accumulate. Gau should use Conjurer Rage (making sure Setzer gets in Poison before Gau uses Frazzle is important!). If Gau won't put Rerise on people, go ahead and have Setzer next summon Seraph. Otherwise, the party needs Haste and Regen, although Setzer will lose Regen frequently with his equipment because of Zone Eater's Aero spell, so don't prioritize his Regen. Once buffs are in place, Setzer can prioritize healing while Terra uses Storm and Celes uses Ice2.

| Edgar | Fire Lance | None | Dragon Helm | Genji Armor | Dragoon Seal | Hero Ring | Palidor |
| Setzer | Avenger | Aegis Shield | Red Cap | Genji Armor | Zephyr Cape | Life Bell | Starlet |

Everyone is Backrow except Sabin. Terra can have Apocalypse or Soul Sabre depending on what you took in Narshe. This is a very easy battle but there will be a lot of deaths and revives happening. Do NOT let Sabin or Edgar do anything offensive until they have Rerise, and they should in fact be the priority for it. Then Setzer for Rerise, then Terra. Once Edgar has Rerise, he can put Slow on Tonberry and then use Bio Blaster.

Keeping everyone at high health is NOT a priority; simply keeping them alive (even at low health post-revive), however, is, so don't waste time curing and restoring. Therefore, you should use a Phoenix Down/Life, and/or Rerise, and then move on.

Terra should just use Fire3 and then give her a Tincture if she winds up needing it. Sabin should attack. Edgar should Jump after he's used Bio Blaster once. Setzer should keep putting Rerise on people. Master Tonberry will frequently counter the Figaro Bros. with Step Mine, but not always. When he's close to the party, he will use Gank twice, and you will either dodge it or die to it, no in between. Not a hard fight, but you will die frequently.

| Cyan | Murasame | None | Stat Hat | Genji Armor | Sprint Shoes | Zephyr Cape | Kirin |
| Edgar | * | Thunderguard | Dragon Helm | Genji Armor | Back Guard | Nirvana Band | Palidor |

Everyone is Backrow. Celes can have Illumina (give Edgar Soul Sabre) or Soul Sabre (give Edgar any elemental sword) depending on what you took from Narshe. Gau should use HasteX, and then he should use Regen on Cyan. If he dies after this, he can stay dead. Edgar can use Cure2 on the party on his first turn after Katanasoul has acted, or he can use it on an individual, depending on what Katanasoul did. Celes can put Slow on him. Now pause.

If Katanasoul has already used Gale Cut, Celes's second turn should be summoning Phantom. If not, start applying more buffs and heals to the party until Katanasoul DOES use Gale Cut, then have Celes summon Phantom.

After Phantom is summoned, it's a race to the next Gale Cut. Edgar and Celes should be using Rasp.

What about Cyan?  Cyan, the entire battle, should be using only Mindblow Bushido. If Gau is still somehow alive, have him on Item duty or just pass his turn; undoing Invisibility with magic is not good, and we are not interested in reducing Katanasoul's HP.

| Setzer | Avenger | Viper Darts | Genji Helm | Crystal Mail | Daryl's Soul | Life Bell | Seraph |

Everyone is Backrow. Terra can have Apocalypse or Soul Sabre depending on what you took from Narshe. If you are lucky, Doom Gaze will flee and you can hunt him down restored while he has less health. But it doesn't matter.

Terra should put Regen on Edgar. Edgar should put Haste on Setzer. Gau should use Conjurer Rage. If Gau does not Rerise Edgar, have Setzer do that immmediately. If Gau then does not Rerise Terra, have Setzer do that next. If Gau then does not Rerise himself, have Setzer do that. If Gau finally does not Rerise Setzer, have Setzer do that.

In the meantime, Edgar can Jump, and Terra can Morph and then use Fire3. Setzer can go on healing duty, including reapplying Rerise if Gau won't. Easy battle.

| Strago | Doomstick | Iceguard | Circlet | Moogle Hide | Sage Stone | Quartz Charm | Zoneseek |

Everyone is Backrow. Edgar can have a Nirvana Band or Power Glove depending on when you went to Owzer's Mansion. Terra can have an Apocalypse or Soul Sabre depending on what you got from Narshe.

Curly is in the top center and your goal is to take him out. Edgar can Jump on Curly. If Edgar is in the air, Terra should cast Regen on Strago. If Edgar is not YET in the air, Terra should cast RegenX on the party. Once Edgar lands, Terra can put Regen on Edgar if he had jumped previously. Strago can just use Blowfish.

Once Curly is dead, if Strago has Mute, someone should fix this. While Moe and Larry are doing their nonsense, Strago can now double-cast Dark on Moe (front right), while Edgar continues to Jump and Terra continues to use Fire3, all on Moe. Larry will eventually leave, leaving only Moe. Eventually, Moe will die, and Shemp will appear and then leave.

| Strago | Doomstick | Iceguard | Circlet | Moogle Hide | Sage Stone | Quartz Charm | Zoneseek |

Everyone is Backrow. Edgar can have a Nirvana Band or Power Glove depending on when you went to Owzer's Mansion. Terra can have an Apocalypse or Soul Sabre depending on what you got from Narshe. Wrexsoul will possess someone, but this doesn't matter.

Edgar should Jump on one of them. If he is in the air, Terra can put Regen on Strago and then put Regen on Edgar when he lands. If Edgar is still grounded and/or Terra went first, Terra can use RegenX. After both of them have Regen, she can Morph and cast Storm. Strago can cast Tsunami if you have it or Aqualung.

Edgar's Jumps should be spread between the two enemies. If he gets off a double-Jump on one enemy, have him focus more on the other. They each have 40,000 HP, and the goal here is to kill them at the same time (approximately). When they both die, the battle ends.

| Celes | * | Hero Shield | Mystery Veil | Force Armor | Quartz Charm | Magic Cube | Alexandr |

Everyone is Backrow. Celes can have the Illumina or Soul Sabre, depending on what you took in Narshe. Have Gau use Conjurer Rage.

Your first goal is to kill all the Hidonites while Strago remains alive, as this will trigger Black Omen for Strago to learn. After a few turns, the Hidonites will revive, and the bottom left one will cast Shield for Strago's other Lore he can learn.

To kill the Hidonites quickly, Relm can cast Meteor, Strago can do a party-wide Blaze, and Celes can do party-wide Ice3. Once the Hidonites are dead AND after they revive, you ignore them and focus all of your attention on Hidon since the battle ends when he dies.

Strago should double-cast Ice2, Celes can now just attack (if Illumina) or Ice3 (if Soul Sabre). Relm is on healing duty with party-wide Cure3 or have her attack your own party with the Dali Brush for single-target healing. If things look good, she can cast Flare if you have it, but keep her MP high for Cure3.

| Celes | * | Hero Shield | Circlet | Crystal Mail | Back Guard | Zephyr Cape | Phantom |

Everyone is Backrow. Terra can have Soul Sabre or Apocalypse depending on what you took in Narshe. Celes can have Soul Sabre or Illumina depending on what you took in Narshe. Float before battle! MagiMaster is a souped up Number 024, except he's going to be a lot easier. His whole gimmick is elemental shifting, and he telegraphs his weakness. If he uses Ice, you use Ice, and so on.

Before you do any attacking, you should consider your party's buffs and what MagiMaster's current elemental affinity is. Your party can easily tolerate Earth, Fire, Bolt, and Ice, so if he's not using these spells, hit him with the spells below until he changes. Someone should also put Slow on MagiMaster.

Setzer should put RegenX on the party and then Rerise everyone, starting with himself, then Terra, then Celes, then Strago. Celes should put Haste on people with Setzer first and order not mattering after. Terra and Strago should each put Shell on everyone, order doesn't matter. Celes and Terra can take turns healing as needed. Once everyone has their buffs, Setzer now focuses on healing while everyone else restores their MP; you don't want to be in mid-assault and run out of MP.

Once the assault begins, Setzer is still on healing and MP restoration. MagiMaster has 100,000 HP to deal with. However, he is stupidly easy, and this is what you do:

If MagiMaster uses an Ice spell, Terra should cast Ice3, Celes should cast Ice3, Strago should double-cast Ice2.
If MagiMaster uses a Fire spell, Terra should cast Fire3, Strago should cast Blaze.
If MagiMaster uses a Wind spell, Terra should cast Break, Strago should cast Blaze.
If MagiMaster uses an Earth spell, Celes should cast Quartr.
If MagiMaster uses a Bolt spell, Terra should cast Bolt3, Celes should cast Bolt3.
If MagiMaster uses a Water spell, Strago should cast Tsunami, Terra should cast Storm.
If MagiMaster uses a Holy spell, Celes should cast Holy.
If MagiMaster uses a Dark spell, Strago should double-cast Dark, Setzer should cast Poison.

| Setzer | Fixed Dice | Aegis Shield | Red Cap | Genji Armor | Amulet | Wall Ring | Seraph |

Everyone is Backrow except Sabin.  Float before battle!

First, have Sabin put Slow on the Dragon, Edgar put Haste on Gau, Setzer put RegenX on the party, and Gau uses Conjurer Rage.

Now, have Edgar Jump, Sabin attack, and Setzer heal (and help Gau with Rerise if Gau can't figure it out). If at some point everyone is buffed and Gau still has not used Frazzle, have Setzer cast Sap. Also feel free to have Setzer attack since you are generally safe and he will twiddle his thumbs a lot wanting something to do.

If Brown Dragon starts to speed up (via prompt), have one of the Figaro brothers put Slow on him, whoever's turn comes first.

If Brown Dragon uses Grav Bomb, immediately have one of the Figaro brothers cast Float to get that person back up as Brown Dragon will follow up with Quake. Otherwise, easy battle.

| Terra | * | Crystal Kite | Circlet | Crystal Mail | Magic Cube | Gem Box | Carbunkl |

Everyone is Backrow except Umaro. Terra can have Soul Sabre or Apocalypse, depending on what you took in Narshe.

Gau should start with HasteX and then use Conjurer Rage. Unfortunately, Purple Dragon is likely to cast SlowX on the party; get Remedies on whoever needs it and proceed with a somewhat slower fight.

Setzer should start with Regen on Umaro, Rerise himself (if Gau hasn't done it yet), and then is healing the party and restoring Terra's MP as needed. If Gau refuses to Rerise people intelligently, have Setzer, in order, put Rerise on Terra, then Umaro, then Gau. No need to rush, though; give Gau a chance as you're pretty safe in this fight.

Terra should put Slow on the Purple Dragon, Morph, and then cast Bolt3 for the rest of the battle. If you get the prompt saying Purple Dragon is speeding up, have her recast Slow.

Have Celes cast Slow and then Ice3, recasting Slow if you get the prompt that Red Dragon's speed is increasing. Setzer should be on healing duty and help restore Celes's MP as needed. Sabin should attack, and Edgar should Jump. Easy fight.

| Setzer | Avenger | Crystal Kite | Red Cap | Force Armor | Quartz Charm | Sprint Shoes | Seraph |
| Celes | * | Hero Shield | Circlet | Light Robe | Life Bell | Magic Cube | Crusader |

Everyone is Backrow.  Terra can have Soul Sabre or Apocalypse, depending on what you took in Narshe.  Celes can have Illumina or Soul Sabre, depending on what you took in Narshe.

At the start, White Dragon is likely to kill someone, so get that person back up. Someone else may die; get that person back up. Repeat and eventually White Dragon will stop being so aggressive with Holy/Flare and instead use Quartr. Unless you summon Seraph, Celes will not be getting Rerise because of her Reflect status; this is fine. Get Haste, Regen, Rerise, and Shell on everyone else as this is your number one priority. Have someone Slow White Dragon and Setzer can cast Sap.

From now on, Strago will double-cast Dark and nothing else. Sometimes, he will only get one Dark in because White Dragon will counter with Holy and kill him; this is fine. Get him back with, in order, Rerise, then Shell, then Regen. If there is an opportunity for Setzer to damage and not heal, have him cast Poison; otherwise, have him use failed Slots to heal the party (which heals Celes!). Celes is backup on Rerise/Item duty, and she can give herself and Strago Tinctures if needed. Terra can Morph and cast Fire3 for decent damage.

If White Dragon is "speeding up" via the prompt, someone (not Strago) must immediately cast Slow on him.

White Dragon is arguably one of the hardest Dragons in the game, but this is more a tense fight and not a difficult one as you have to maintain focus. Keep healing, keep people buffed, and just let Strago and Terra do their thing with occasional support from Setzer, and don't try to rush it.

Everyone is Backrow except Umaro. Terra can have Soul Sabre or Apocalypse, depending on what you took in Narshe.

Locke should heal or attack and can be front or back row on your preference of surviving vs. attacking.

Terra should put RegenX on the party, Shell Edgar, Morph, and then just cast Fire3, in that order. If Locke is ever frozen, she can take over healing duty.

Edgar should first Haste Terra and then Jump. If you're lucky or find a good rhythm, Edgar will avoid most everything Silver Dragon does.

Step Mine can hurt, but it doesn't get used too often. You have two people who can use Life2 to bring people back; if someone dies, pause the offense (Umaro will make this up for you) and focus on getting that person back and re-buffed.

Silver Dragon can't do much to Umaro...

Everyone is Backrow. Terra can have a Soul Sabre or Apocalypse, depending on what you took in Narshe.

Gau is the most vulnerable person here. Have him use Griffon Rage and have someone else be ready to Rerise/Life2 him. Terra should Slow the Dragon and Regen anyone who needs it, then use Morph, then cast Bolt3. She'll eventually run out of MP, so have Setzer help her MP.  Setzer is on healing duty after he puts Rerise on everyone. Edgar should put Haste on anyone who needs it and then Jump. Easy fight.

| Gogo | Doomstick | Multiguard | Circlet | Chocobo Hide | Sprint Shoes | * | N/A |

| Edgar | Trident | None | Dragon Helm | Force Armor | * | Nirvana Band | Palidor |
| Cyan | Mutsunokami | None | Crystal Helm | Force Armor | * | Sprint Shoes | Kirin |

You have two options (the strategy is mostly the same and it's a question on safety vs. speed):  Ghost Ring or No Ghost Ring.  If Ghost Ring, replace the * above with Ghost Rings.  If No Ghost Ring, replace the * above with Zephyr Cape (Gogo), Back Guard (Locke), Dragoon Seal (Edgar), and Quartz Charm (Cyan).

Non Ghost Ring path:
Cyan should use Mindblow and nothing else. Edgar should use SlowX or Slow on the Green Dragon (I had better luck with SlowX). After that, Edgar should use Rasp and heal the party as needed, in that order. Gogo should use Mindblow and heal the party as needed, in that order. Locke should only be healing the party (and why Gogo/Edgar are only backup healers). Green Dragon only has 5,000 MP.

Ghost Ring path:
This is actually a safer approach because Dark, Poison, and Bio Blast from Green Dragon will all heal your party members. However, it's a bit longer as we're still going to MP drain Green Dragon, but only Cyan will do it (meaning you need 10 Mindblows). Everyone else is on item healing duty to make up for a lack of party-wide healing via spells.

Everyone is Backrow. Edgar should use Drill once to inflict Sap and then Jump. Setzer should open with RegenX while Edgar is still grounded and Celes can put Rerise on Edgar first if Gau didn't do it while Gau is on Conjurer Rage.

From then on, Setzer and Celes just stand by for healing. Very easy fight.

| Name | Right Hand | Left Hand | Head | Body | Relic | Relic | Esper |

| Terra | Soul Sabre | Crystal Kite | Gold Helm | Minerva | Gem Box | Magic Cube | Carbunkl |
| Setzer | Avenger | Multiguard | Genji Helm | Lazy Shell | Life Bell | Spirit Stone | Seraph |
| Celes | Rune Blade | Aegis Shield | Circlet | Minerva | Magic Cube | Ribbon | Phantom |
| Sabin | Stormfang | Ocean Claw | Tiger Mask | Lazy Shell | Life Bell | Sprint Shoes | Golem |

Everyone is in Backrow except Sabin and Float before battle!

This is an elemental-cycling battle. Before anything happens, have Sabin put Slow on Kaiser and Setzer summon Seraph. Have Terra Morph and cast Fire3.

Upon being hit with an element, Kaiser will "shift" into that element and use that element's spells against you. Terra just used Fire3, so Kaiser Dragon will now use Fire spells, getting more and more powerful with his spells.

Your goal is to cycle him through the elements of Fire, Ice, Bolt, Water, Earth, Wind, Holy Dark. The order does not matter, but for your own sanity, decide on an order and stick with it. You have to be fast because of the spell power increase with each of his turns. But if you're too fast, your shifting element won't register, and Kaiser will stay in an element and likely kill you.

That said, Kaiser is kind of screwy. Sometimes, you complete a full cycle of elements without actually doing so--he will announce that his power is dissipating and will then use Purge on the party (why we don't use buffs). Sometimes you will be patient enough and he will shift, but you go through all the elements and he won't "end" his cycle when you try to end it (see below). In this case, you need to hopefully have a good memory of what spells you've seen him cast, or just retry all the elements again.

In order to actually complete a cycle, at the end of all the elements, a non-elemental attack must connect. Sabin's Bum Rush/Pummel/Suplex will do just fine. Amid all this, you still have to drain his 150,000 HP. You will need approximately 4-5 cycles. If you DO NOT shift him, you will die; he will throw Ultima at the party and one-shot everyone. There is no way around this.

This is an order that worked for me. From above, we had Terra use Fire3, so I will repeat that:

Terra casts Fire3. Kaiser is in Fire mode.
Terra OR Celes casts Ice3. Kaiser is in Ice mode.
Terra casts Bolt3. Kaiser is in Bolt mode.
Celes casts Holy. Kaiser is in Holy mode.
Setzer casts Sap. Kaiser is in Dark mode.
Celes casts Demi. Kaiser is in Earth mode.
Sabin attacks. Kaiser is in Water mode.
Terra casts Break. Kaiser is in Wind mode.
Sabin uses Bum Rush. Cycle is complete.

In order for a mode to "stick," it's good to let Kaiser get off the first spell of that mode. You can withstand all of them pretty easily, with Holy and Dark being somewhat annoying/damaging. After Purge, REAPPLY FLOAT for Earth mode again.

While the ONE PERSON is doing their thing to shift his modes, everyone else should be always healing and MP restoring. Don't wait until the middle of the fight to deal with this. Keep everyone in great condition.

This setup is 4-5 rotations as stated. So if you have completed 4 rotations and for some reason you run into the mess that is "you did everything right but he's not shifting," just go all out with offense with your best spells/Blitzes and take him out before he gets to his Ultima. He is surprisingly very easy, but this is a long and patient battle.

### <a name="ultima"></a>Ultima Weapon (Party 2)
| Name | Right Hand | Left Hand | Head | Body | Relic | Relic | Esper |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Edgar | Longinus | None | Dragon Helm | Genji Armor | Dragoon Seal | Nirvana Band | Palidor |
| Setzer | Avenger | Genji Shield | Genji Helm | Lazy Shell | Life Bell | Spirit Stone | Seraph |
| Celes | Rune Blade | Aegis Shield | Circlet | Light Robe | Magic Cube | Ribbon | Phantom |
| Gau | Magic Bone | Thunder Guard | Skull Cap | Dragon Hide | Sprint Shoes | Amulet | Fenrir |

Everyone is Backrow and has Float before battle! Gau should summon Fenrir and then use Conjurer Rage.

Edgar should put Haste on Setzer and then Jump. You now have two options: get through the boss faster but with a higher likelihood of dying/running out of MP, or take it slow, guarantee survival, and be here for a while because Ultima is a war of attrition.

If you want to go all out, Celes will cast Ice3 and Setzer is on recovery, using either party-wide Cure2 or Cure3 after everything Ultima does. At some point, they'll both have to pause and recover their MP, and the timing is just right that when this happens, Ultima will be casting Meteor, Flare, Quasar, and Mind Blast a lot. Thus this is high risk.

Taking it slowly, nothing really changes except Celes and Setzer should be acting only in response to Ultima's actions.  Ultima hurts party? Setzer undoes it and Celes possibly tops of Setzer's MP. Anyone not with Float? They need Float--Float must always be maintained. Only when Ultima misses or does something non-threatening and Setzer can just use Cure2 can Celes cast Ice3.

There is no point in buffs at the start of the battle because Ultima will use Purge. The FIRST time he uses it, pause to assess your team.  If 3-4 do not have Rerise, Setzer needs to summon Seraph now. If 1-2 people need Rerise, Celes and Setzer can manually cast Rerise. Setzer can time RegenX when Edgar is not in the air, and Setzer needs a Haste from Celes or Edgar (whomever is first, but forcing Edgar to do it can pair nicely with Setzer's RegenX to keep Edgar grounded).

Setzer and Celes should ALWAYS have a full ATB and just pass their turn while Edgar slowly chips away at 120,000 HP, doing over 4,000 Jumps (meaning you need 30 single Jumps to end this fight; the occasional double-Jump or Ice3 will obviously reduce this). Occasionally, Edgar needs to stop attacking and help Setzer and Celes recover people with Cure2, Haste, and/or Float.

If at any time you see Ultima flash, no matter how aggressive you're playing, Celes needs to cast Dispel and then Edgar can follow with Slow (just once; if he fails, let someone else do it so he can get back to doing more important things). The Slower approach is extremely safe, but you will be there for a while.

### <a name="inferno"></a>Inferno (Party 3)

| Gogo | Doomstick | Multiguard | Circlet | Chocobo Hide | Sprint Shoes | Zephyr Cape | N/A |
| Locke | Blood Sword | Avenger | Dark Hood | Mirage Vest | Back Guard | Thief Glove | Phoenix |
| Edgar | Trident | None | Dragon Helm | Force Armor | Dragoon Seal | Nirvana Band | Palidor |
| Cyan | Mutsunokami | None | Crystal Helm | Force Armor | Quartz Charm | Sprint Shoes | Kirin |

Everyone except Cyan is Backrow. Edgar should first cast SlowX and then Jump on the main body for the rest of the fight. The arms will die and revive, but don't waste time re-applying SlowX. You can if you want to feel safer, but you're very safe in this party, and there's just not much need for it.

Cyan should just attack the main body. If the main body is all that's left after the arms have died, have him use Dispatch since it's more reliable and does more damage than a basic attack (we only attack to get the wind spell to come out).

Gogo should use Conjurer Rage and Locke is on healing duty, but at the start, both can sneak in Bolt2 or Fire3 spells. Locke will eventually need some MP, but by this point everyone should have Rerise so it's not too risky. Occasionally, people will die, but as long as Locke always has over 60 MP you can use Life2, so make sure that's there.

The biggest threat from Inferno is actually if he puts Stop on Cyan, if only because it drags out the battle since Locke may be busy healing and you just have to wait out Cyan's recovery. Still a fairly easy battle.

### <a name="guardian"></a>Guardian (Party 1)
| Name | Right Hand | Left Hand | Head | Body | Relic | Relic | Esper |

| Terra | Soul Sabre | Crystal Kite | Gold Helm | Minerva | Gem Box | Magic Cube | Carbunkl |
| Setzer | Avenger | Multiguard | Genji Helm | Lazy Shell | Life Bell | Spirit Stone | Seraph |
| Celes | Rune Blade | Aegis Shield | Circlet | Minerva | Magic Cube | Ribbon | Phantom |
| Sabin | Stormfang | Ocean Claw | Tiger Mask | Lazy Shell | Life Bell | Sprint Shoes | Golem |

Float before battle! There are several phases to this fight. The first two phases are Guardian's Ultros form and your buffing phase.

Celes needs to give herself Regen, Sabin should summon Golem, Setzer should summon Seraph, and Terra is going to spend 4 turns putting Shell on everyone.  Celes will then put Haste on Setzer and Terra and then put Safe on everyone. Sabin can put Slow on Guardian until it connects. Setzer should be healing the party with Cure2, and anyone except Terra (who is very busy) can undo Imp status as needed. Don't worry about attacking yet until all buffs are applied; just stay healed and alive.

No matter what Guardian's form is, he is still a machine, so he is still weak to Water and Bolt spells. Celes should cast Bolt3, Terra should Morph and cast Bolt3, Sabin should attack, and Setzer should be on MP restoration and healing. If Setzer needs help recovering, Sabin can use Mantra. Do this the whole fight while taking note of grievances of each form below:

First is Ultros's form, and only Tentacle is a threat which Setzer can easily fix.
Second is Soul Train's form, and Evil Toot can cause a lot of issues and force you to stop dealing damage and undo its status effects.
Third is Dadaluma's form, and one party-wide Bolt3 will end his partners.
Fourth is Crane's form, and it will put up a barrier. If anyone is without Float status, fix this ASAP and have someone cast Dispel on the barrier.
Fifth is Doom Gaze's form, and someone will get hit with Condemned so be ready to fix this when that person dies (Celes is immune).
Sixth and final is Hidon's form, and it'll use Refract. Have someone cast Dispel. Setzer may need to switch to party-wide Cure3 because Quasar will hurt.

Overall, Guardian is a long battle with a lot of gimmicks, but the above point the only real issues with the fights; the general strategy described above the above issues will take him down without much trouble.

| Locke | Excalibur | Multiguard | Ninja Mask | Mirage Vest | Life Bell | Thief Glove | Phoenix |
| Gogo | Quarterstaff | Multiguard | Skull Cap | Snow Muffler | Sprint Shoes | Stat Stick | N/A |

Gogo should have Items, Magic, and whatever else. Gogo and Locke are forever on healing duty by any means necessary (items or magic). The ONLY status worth maintaining on people is Regen, unless you feel it is beneficial and are able to put Haste on Cyan. You are going to get hit with a lot of status ailments in this fight, but only Stop and Muddle are real problems; everything else is a minor inconvenience.  The last thing you will want is a Muddled Cyan one-shotting your whole team with a wind spell from his sword, so make sure everything is taken care of immediately.

Cyan should only just attack.  He will either do very good damage or, if Gale Cut triggers, do incredible damage. If he gets hit with Berserk, leave him alone. Edgar should either Jump or use Cure3 as needed, but your main priority here is keeping Cyan alive.

At some point, you will be nonstop battling the Zombie status and spamming Holy Waters on your team.  This is normal, and EVERYONE should be helping with Holy Waters, including Cyan. You really want to make sure everyone has as high health as possible to avoid Zombie entirely. Locke and Gogo will weather through anything except physical attacks with no problem, while Edgar and Cyan are made of glass and get hurt by everything.

And because Zombification is the major issue here, we have no need for Rerise, which is why Gogo is here to copy Locke's spell list and help with actual healing. However, with Zombie, there are a few rounds where you'll do no damage and be busy undoing the status. This is normal; this fight is very painless and more annoying.

| Celes | Falchion | Hero Shield | Circlet | Minerva | Ribbon | Sprint Shoes | Phantom |
| Sabin | Stormfang | Frostgore | Tiger Mask | Lazy Shell | Life Bell | Nirvana Band | Golem |

Float before the battle. Terra is going to Morph and then spam Fire3 and absolutely nothing else while everyone else is here to make sure she stays alive and has MP to spam Fire3. The only concern here is when Asura uses Loc Nar which will one-shot Terra, so be ready. Fire3 is also more economical than Ultima (damage vs. MP cost), so we won't use Ultima. Terra may take one break, however, if some people are frozen and she's not; have her throw a Fire on the team--everyone will withstand it no problem.

To start, Celes needs to Slow Asura and Setzer can summon Seraph. After, Celes and Setzer should prioritize Rerise before doing normal healing as the battle goes on. Sabin can use Mantra or Chakra depending on what's needed, but if you have an opening, go ahead and use Bum Rush for good damage!

Other than being frozen, Asura is the easiest of the trio.

| Mog | Longinus | None | Dragon Helm | Force Armor | Dragoon Seal | Power Glove | Palidor |
| Strago | Doomstick | Multiguard | Circlet | Dragon Hide | Sage Stone | Magic Cube | Carbunkl |
| Relm | Dali Brush | Thunderguard | Cat Hood | Lazy Shell | Magic Cube | Life Bell | Zoneseek |

A difficult enemy with our leftover party members. And yet, this will prove to be a very easy fight, although it will be a very long one.  A note:  should anyone die without Rerise, you need to wait for two others to have full ATB so you can either Phoenix Down + Relm's Cure3 or Phoenix Down + Potion to get that person back up.  This will happen a few times because of the Charm status Isis will inflict on others where you need to kill one of your team members to undo it.

At the start, Mog should get Haste on Strago and Relm and Relm needs to use RegenX to get Mog Regen status. If Mog should ever get afflicted with Berserk, you are free to leave him alone as he will not only do more damage, but he'll Jump most of the time. If the whole party has Rerise and Relm gets hit with Berserk, you can leave her be, too, as whoever is in love with Isis is going to get a lot of free healing. However, get her a Green Cherry whenever you need control or if someone doesn't have Rerise. Anyone else with Berserk should be taken out of it immediately.

Now, if someone gets hit with Charm, you either need to act immediately or can put it off for a round or two and not stress out. If Strago or Mog get hit with Charm, they need to die and be brought back to life immediately; Relm and Gau can wait a minute.

Buffs applied, Gau uses Conjurer Rage, Mog uses Jump.  Relm's #1 priority is healing, but go ahead and summon Zoneseek on her first turn.  When things seem safe or you feel confident, have her Sketch Isis and watch Holy tear through Isis.

Strago will double-cast Slow then Dark until Isis has Slow, and from then on will double-cast Dark.  When he runs out of MP, which he will, have him double-cast Osmose. Nobody else should need MP, even with Relm using a lot of Cure3.  Occasionally, have Strago throw a Potion on someone.

A worst case scenario can present itself where Gau is uncontrollable because of Rage, one character has Charm, and the other two have Berserk.  This happened to me several times and is a bit concerning but more amusing as you just patiently wait for someone to die and come back with Rerise so you can act, which is why you must ALWAYS have Rerise on.

Isis will spam Quasar a lot eventually, but this won't one-shot anyone in good health. Her other attacks are nonissues as her bolt based spells will heal the party or be shrugged off by them (except Mog who only mitigates with Force Armor), and Storm does no significant damage.  Just keep up the slow but steady grind and Isis will fall.

| Gau | Magic Bone | Multiguard | Skull Cap | Snow Muffler | Life Bell | Sprint Shoes | Fenrir |
| Gogo | Punisher | Multiguard | Red Cap | Lazy Shell | Life Bell | Sprint Shoes | N/A |

This setup will also work for the non-Esper-Level run!  However, be prepared for a tougher and more exhausting fight, and Edgar needs over 1,100 HP (he can sacrifice a Dragon Helm for a Stat Hat if necessary).  Just make sure to have no Espers if you are doing the no-Esper-Level run!

This will be more exhausting than anything else (prepare approximately 45 minutes to 1.5 hours). Four segments, with the first being okay, the second being the most difficult (and where you are likely to die), the third being a joke, and the last being tiring, you're doing a combined total of 410,000 HP damage.  Your goal is to play very defensively and not rush in with attacks and heals.  Fortunately, with the exception of Edgar who is basically a glass cannon whose weak defenses are mitigated by the invulnerability of being airborne, this is an extremely sturdy party and will withstand most everything thrown at you.  Edgar will change his weapon twice (once away from Longinus, once back to Longinus).

You need Green Cherries and all of your Ethers/Elixirs/X-Potions/X-Ethers and that Megalixir for this.  Maybe.  So do not ever feel afraid to use one at ANY stage.

With the exception of Edgar on a no-Esper-level run, your Haste is permanent. On the second stage, your Regen status will all turn into Sap, but you'll be perfectly fine. You may replace Terra's Quartz Charm with either a White Cape or a Ribbon because Kefka's final phase will see Train which will put random status ailments on the party. If she is turned into a Zombie, that's a problem for her. But if she is hit with Mute or Stop, that's a problem for the rest of your team.  I never needed to switch it out (despite her getting hit with ugly status ailments) and having permanent Shell+Safe made her sturdier for all the rest of the fights so she could heal better, but it's your call.

Good luck!

<a name="first"></a>**_Face, Short Arm, Long Arm_**
Do not worry about buffs as they will just be Dispeled. Everyone will do essentially one thing--
Gau: Conjurer Rage
Gogo: Conjurer Rage
Edgar: Jump
Terra: Party-wide Cure3

Edgar should first target the Face (top) which has 30,000 HP. Once he dies, the fight is significantly more manageable. Terra should pause on her turn until Edgar is on the ground to maximize healing potential, and she should only be using party-wide Cure3. Trying to single target can be disastrous as in between turns, something can and often will go horribly wrong.

Once Face is dead, target Short Arm (rightmost, in the background) which also has 30,000 HP. Finally, target Long Arm (leftmost, in the foreground). This has 40,000 HP and is a nonthreat except for the nonstop Dispel that will happen (and why we are not buffing). MAKE SURE EVERYONE HAS FLOAT BEFORE IT DIES as it will cast Magnitude as a death counter.  Also try and gauge its HP to make sure your own HP is topped off; as soon as you are done with this, the next four enemies are all going to get attacks on you before you can do anything!
[Top](#top)
<a name="second"></a>*__Hit, Magic, Tiger, Tools__*
This is without a doubt the hardest fight of the sequence. There is a lot that is thrown at you at the start, and they get deadlier as targets die off. You may occasionally have rounds where you're doing nothing except healing, and that is okay.

In fact, in the first few rounds, you are probably going to be focused entirely on healing (let Edgar and Gogo help as needed) because these four will all attack you at the start of the fight.

As soon as possible, however, Gau and Gogo both go back on Conjurer Rage.  Edgar once again uses Jump, but at your discretion whenever you feel you have a chance (I usually didn't feel confident until Hit was dead), have Edgar cast SlowX. Terra is again on party-wide Cure3 or Life2 as needed.

Hit is the first target (purple guy in front top-right) who has 20,000 HP fortunately. He needs to die because he hits hard and will quickly destroy your team if left alone. However, upon death, he will randomly attack party members for 8 hits at heavy power, so be ready for it!  You may need a minute to recover from all this before moving on; calm Gogo down with a Green Cherry if needed so he can help recover people.

Magic (tan guy in leftmost back) is the next target, also with 20,000 HP. He is responsible for Dispel, so once he is dead, you are able to start buffing again if you desire, but you may not have time for it because the battle picks up quickly with his death (and gets a lot easier). Expect a death counter with Cyclonic.

Tiger (tiger head at bottom in the front) and Tools (girl in red in the middle) each have 30,000 HP. Get Edgar to SlowX them if he hasn't cast it previously. Let Edgar throw an Ether or Elixir on Terra if she has under 100 MP (Tinctures are useless in this fight; use your bigger items). Make absolutely sure that everyone has Rerise (especially Edgar, whose nonstop Jump has likely hurt this) now that Dispel is gone with Magic's death.  These two are going to use heavier damaging attacks from now on that will tear through the party, but the nonstop healing should overcome this.

Upon their death, though, expect Exploder which WILL one-shot someone (and why Rerise is important).  The rest of Kefka is a lot easier.
[Top](#top)
<a name="third"></a>**_Girl, Sleep_**

Girl (head in the back) has only 20,000 HP but absorbs all elemental damage. Edgar's first turn is to switch his Longinus for Gungnir. He then Jumps on Girl until she is dead, and then spend a turn switching back to Longinus. If you try to kill Sleep (purple man in front) first, Girl will just revive him. Girl will also frequently heal both of them, but Edgar is more than capable of getting rid of her. Upon death, Girl will use Peace, which with our setup is very likely to miss but can one-shot someone.

At this point, there is no more real threat to the party nor anything stopping you from just annihilating the rest. However, let Sleep do his devastating attacks while you spend a minute calming down Gau and Gogo (who were still on Conjurer Rage) with Green Cherries and start applying buffs on everyone.  Make sure everyone has Float, Safe, Shell, Rerise, Regen, Haste on.  If someone has Sap that isn't going away because of some shenanigans, kill them and revive them to give them back Regen.  Throw your Elixirs around as needed.  While Terra is putting Shell on people, Edgar can heal.  While Edgar is putting Safe on people, Terra can heal.  Don't try and put these two on Safe/Shell together because although the rest of these bosses are easy, you can still die.

Now put Gau and Gogo back on Conjurer Rage and have Edgar back on Jump and Terra can heal or throw an Ultima if you're feeling confident to remove Sleep's 60,000 HP.
[Top](#top)
<a name="fourth"></a>**_Kefka_**
120,000 HP is all that stands between you and the credits.  Edgar will do approximately 6,000-7,000 per single Jump.  Gogo's Frazzle will occasionally see him followup with a Dark spell for a few hundred.  It is approximately 17-20 Jumps from Edgar to end this, fewer if he will double Jump.

Immediately, Gau and Gogo use Conjurer Rage.  Terra again is on party-wide Cure3 and Edgar is on Jump.  Most Jumps, Kefka will counter with Overdrive, which will not kill Edgar if he has over 1,100 HP, so make sure Terra ensures this is the case.

Now, there is a lot of RNG that goes into Kefka's behavior plus Edgar's willingness to double Jump.  If you are lucky, Kefka will spam his elemental attacks, which only Edgar is vulnerable to, and Edgar will double Jump a lot, making this fight end in about 8-9 turns. If you are NOT lucky, Edgar will only single Jump, and Kefka will spam Train, which puts random statuses on people, and Purge, which undoes all that buffing you did previously.

Anytime Kefka uses Train, Gau and Gogo can continue but Edgar and Terra both stop and work on undoing everything they can.  If either Edgar or Terra are unable to help, one of them needs to calm Gogo down with a Green Cherry so Gogo can help. Maybe do this anyway to speed things up.  If Kefka uses Purge, your priority statuses to rebuild are Shell for Edgar and then Regen/Haste/Float/Rerise for the party.

When the little head appears to tell you that the end is near, PAUSE.  The screen will start shaking, and Kefka's very next turn will be reducing everyone's HP (except Edgar's only if he is in the air at the time) to 1.  Terra must immediately undo this or you will lose because Kefka is most likely going to hit the party with something (though he CAN attack a single person).

Above all else, Terra should NEVER be in a hurry to heal. If things are looking good and Edgar is busy, just pause on her turn and wait her out some.  Terra's healing should ALWAYS be an immediate response to Kefka's attack, NOT a pre-emptive heal (even if it's timed to occur after an attack by Kefka).  Feel the rhythm of battle and play very defensively, and Kefka is just a time sink.

Meteor hurts.  Goner is a threat.  Terra becoming a Zombie is awful and is going to happen maybe, maybe even more than once. Kefka is also immune to all status ailments (including Sap). After a Train, you may be doing zero damage for 3-4 rounds while you try and undo everything, only for Kefka to then use Train again.  It's going to happen and just be patient.  You have more than enough items and power to deal with him, and he will never heal himself.  Kefka may also do his "leave you with 1 HP" attack a second time.  As long as you aren't rushing Terra, you will be fine.

However, although Edgar is vulnerable, this is an incredibly safe party.  Pat yourself on the back when you finish, you've earned it!

Chickenlip, Doggo, Rain Man Rages outside of Magitek Research Facility. Onion Kid (upper levels; need Onion Kid x5) and Rhydon and Vulture (lower levels), Flan and Templar (area with tubes; need Templar and 2x Flan for Templar's).

After you get airship, go to near Thamasa for Cephalid, Adamantite, and Chimera Rages (be careful with Chimeras as they are very dangerous).

Miss some Rages from Magitek Research Facility and/or Phantom Train?  Phantom Train's monsters are found in forest west of Veldt (where Bombs/Grenades used to be), and Magitek Research Facility's monsters are found on Triangle Island in northeast corner of map. You will also run into Sealed Gate monsters here.

Good GP grinding party:  Setzer, Gau, Edgar, Cyan, with whatever you consider best equipment. Take them around Jidoor and have Cyan use Dispatch, Gau use Albatross, Edgar use Autocrossbow, and Setzer use Slots. Hold fast forward, hold A, and profit! Setzer's failed Slots will keep people alive, and you may occasionally lose Cyan, but you can just rest at Jidoor.  You get a few thousand GP every few seconds with minimal effort on your part.  Use this to pick up some Sprint Shoes, new weapons/armor from Narshe, a bunch of Potions/Tonics/Tinctures/Red Bulls/Dry Meats/Remedies, and the two Espers from the man in the northwest corner of the map who later builds the Dragon Gate Coliseum.

Go directly east of the Dragon Gate Coliseum man's house to an area that touches the topmost almost-center of the map, northeast of Narshe. There is some grass around mountains. Land here, run into a Cactuar (Edge's Drill will one-shot it), and get an achievement.

Spirit Stone replaces Talisman.  Bracelet still viable for Magic/Magic Defense points.

Against the Centurions and Kefka (not worthy for its own boss section), just hit them with your best attacks.  They do not like water or dark, so Gau can use Sewer Rat, Sabin can attack with Ocean Claws, Setzer can heal or use Poison if you have it, Cyan can use Dispatch, Edgar can Jump with a Trident, Locke can attack with anything or heal, Mog can use Water Rondo. 

Three Commandos and one Mega Armor at Magitek Facility when talking to 24 soldiers. The Commandos die easily.  A Pummel from Sabin or Rain Man Rage from Gau or any Bolt or high level spell from anyone else will make short work of the Heavy Armor.
Feel free to unequip everyone except Terra and/or Locke before time runs out.
Banquet:  "To our fallen comrades," "Leave him in jail," "That, we can't forgive," "We trust Celes," ask each question exactly once before talking about Espers, "Yes, they are a danger," first question you picked, take a break and go fight the three Templars, resume banquet, "That your war is truly over," choose Yes.

Level up Terra and Shadow if necessary.  Chimeras are dangerous, but having Terra cast Imp on them will render them harmless, and Bolt magic/scrolls will do heavy damage.

Steal a (rare) Mystery Egg from a Wight, the ghost enemy in the Phantom Forest, then equip it on Celes for an achievement. Also steal a Club (common) from the same enemy to give Gau some much needed offensive power.
