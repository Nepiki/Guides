## **Introduction**

The Legend of Zelda: Shadow of Night is a Zelda II hack made by the_icepenguin in 2011. The game has significantly overhauled assets and updated graphics to produce an immersive new setting that supports the game's theme.  Some game play changes include a new spell that adds a new physics mechanic, lack of enemy stun lock, improved beam sword speed and distance, the need to revisit palaces to obtain previously inaccessible items and keys and much more.

The hack saw several updates from its initial 1.0 release to the final version 2.5. The final version comes with two patches, an Easy mode and a Hard mode. This set was created with the Easy patch because the only difference between the two is the amount of damage that Link does and takes and how many starting lives you are given. The game design is challenging enough that the added handicap to health, damage and lives does not add much more than frustration to the experience.

The achievements in the set are a mix of progression and challenge achievements. The progression achievements are pretty typical for increasing Link's strength, obtaining key items or reaching new destinations. The challenge achievements are mostly focused on defeating bosses/minibosses under certain conditions. None of the challenge achievements are frustratingly difficult or require a significantly abnormal approach to gameplay.

There is a long play of the hack available, but it was done with a slightly out dated version of the game. As such there are a few minor differences from the version of this game that is used for Retro Achievements such as a few item locations and palace design updates. This guide ensure that players have all the information needed to successfully master the set and understand what the differences in the long play videos and the current version of the hack are.

## **Achievements**

The missable achievements are all associated with defeating bosses and minibosses under certain conditions. The reason they are missable is because once a boss is defeated, it will not respawn.  With a bit of caution, it is very easy to ensure you do not accidentally miss any missable achievements. All of the missable achievements will display the achievement icon in the bottom right letting you know when the achievement is active. If you accidentally make an error, simply die and restart the boss fight in order to attempt the achievement again. If you accidentally do kill the boss and miss the achievement, reset your game and restart from your previous save file.  If you save after you kill the boss, the achievement will not be obtainable on this play through.  The following are the missable achievements in this set.

- Death by a Thousand Cuts [m]
- Dont' Give an Inch [m]
- Helmet Fire [m]
- Stick and Move [m]

_During the battle on the bridge in the Desert Palace, do not let Horsehead move further left than this starting position_

The key to success is to quickly land the first attack and continue to keep up the pressure thereafter.

_Defeat a Gooma in the Forest Palace without jumping_

While there will be three Gooma fights in the Forest Palace, the first encounter is the easiest since there are no other enemies present. Use the Dash spell to increase your running speed. When you attack the Gooma, run in and execute a crouching attack and as soon as it hits run away. Try to preserve distance by hitting the Gooma with the tip of your sword.  It is important to actually hit the Gooma to send it backwards and give yourself a bit more time to run away.  You cannot be too passive in this fight or the Gooma will back you into the corner and you will likely not survive.  If you are having difficulty, increase your attack level.
