## **Introduction**

The Xarnax Run is a challenge run in Zelda II: The Adventure of Link which is essentially a minimalist run. It is named after the first person to provide on stream proof that the run is possible, [Xarnax42](http://www.twitch.tv/xarnax42). Players of the Xarnax Run challenge are only allowed to obtain the minimum required items, spells and upgrades to complete the game. This requires creative routing and exceptional game play to pull off. It is among the most difficult challenges on RetroAchievements. You will also need to use the quit out feature to avoid leveling up at certain points in the run. To quit out, press Start to enter the spell/equipment submenu. Next, on controller 2, hold Up and press A. This will bring you to the Continue/Save screen and reset your exp to zero upon resuming gameplay whether you continue or choose to save and play later.

The following lists detail which upgrades are permitted and which are banned in the Xarnax Run:

**Permitted upgrades**
- all 4 Magic Containers

## **Routing**

The achievements for the Xarnax Run are ordered in such a way to guide players through the recommended routing. Many of the achievements can be done out of order, such as item collecting, however there are some deviations which will make progress especially difficult due to limited keys and limited uses of Fairy magic. Additionally, Three-Eye Rock Palace should be completed first the other palaces can all be completed without a required level up. In this palace, the player will get both of the only permitted magic upgrades as it is impossible to avoid them due to earning experience points from bosses. Doing other palaces first will force an unnecessary upgrade due to the how many experience points Barba gives.

To avoid accidentally ruining a save attempt, a trigger icon for the final achievement will always be present in the bottom right of the emulator to let you know that you are meeting the run requirements. If at any time the icon disappears, this is in an indication that you've obtained a disallowed upgrade and should immediately reset without saving.

A few important tips for the run are as follows:
- Limit the enemies you kill to only the ones that are absolutely necessary. You must manage your exp gain throughout this run.
- Use Fairy to avoid dying any time it is necessary. Dying with magic you could have used is a wasting it. Often times Jump or Fairy likely could have allowed you to survive for another few rooms.
- Be prepared to quit out immediately after placing gems and especially the sequence after defeating Thunderbird (you do not want to have to repeat the fight due to a botched quit out). It is very easy to do if you are prepared since all you need to do is pause the game then take your time to initiate the quit out.
- If you do kill too many enemies prior to defeating a boss or placing a gem, quit out and start fresh. Any items or keys you obtained prior to the quit out will be retained. This can be very helpful when you must deviate from the most direct path to get an item or key.
- I highly recommend watching Xarnax's run linked above in the resources. It will help significantly with the palace routing.

1. Name your file XARNAX (This was a measure put in place to ensure that each of the subset runs unlocks only their appropriate achievements.)

2. Obtain the Magic Container in the cave south of the North Castle

3. Obtain the trophy in the cave in the Tantari Desert. Return the trophy to the girl in Ruto and receive the Jump Spell

4. Visit Bagu in the forest near the Moruge Swamp to receive permission to cross the river in Saria

5. Obtain the hammer in Death Mountain (recommend quit out after obtaining)

6. Obtain the medicine in the cave in the Moruge Swamp

7. Return the medicine to the old woman in Mido and receive the Fairy Spell

8. Obtain the Magic Container in Death Mountain (recommend quit out after obtaining)

9. Obtain the Glove in Midoro Palace. You should not have picked up a key by this point. You will be utilizing Fairy to bypass several doors and save several keys for other palaces. Take the normal routing to the Glove, but use Fairy to bypass the first locked door. Pick up the key in the room with the lava pit. As you approach the next elevator, refill your magic with the red vial hidden in the monster head statue on the wall. As you head left again, you will use a key to unlock a door as you continue toward the Glove. When you reach the room with the Glove, once again use Fairy to bypass the door. After obtaining the Glove, quit out to reset your location back to the North Castle. You should have passed 3 locked doors, using Fairy for 2 of them and 1 key that you obtained in this palace for the other. You should have zero keys when you leave.

10. Obtain the Raft in the Island Palace. You should enter the Island Palace with no keys. Use the statue at the entrance to refill your magic by hitting it. If a red darknut appears, leave the palace and reenter and retry. Survival will be difficult in this palace, so utilization of Fairy and magic refills are important. It is safest to traverse the first room with Fairy. Continue along the top path and retrive the key in the outdoor area without killing the red darknut (he can be hit many times and pushed back to the wall with the key and jumped over). Return to the elevator, descend and head right. Unlock the door with the key you recently obtained and continue right. Unlike the demo video, I recommend skipping the key in the lava pit room (unlike the demo video) and instead just use Fairy to bypass the locked door guarding the Raft. You should have passed 2 locked doors, one using Fairy and unlocking one. You should have zero keys when you leave.

11. Rescue the missing child on Maze Island

12. Retrieve the Magic Container on Maze Island

13. Obtain the Boots in the Maze Island Palace. Take the normal routing to the Boots  TO BE CONTINUED
