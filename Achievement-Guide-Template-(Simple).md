# 1) Introduction

In this section, you can describe what your guide will entail. For example, only missables are covered in this guide, or specific chapters of a game.

# 2) Additional block

You can use this section to give tips- and tricks or other details the user needs to know before heading further into the guide. This is an optional block and only included when needed.

From here on out, you can set up the guide however you prefer. If you wish to just list the achievements then you can copy the achievement blocks and start writing, but if you want to order them, underneath is a template for separating achievements under a group.

Here is where you list the achievements and a guide for each. If multiple achievements are similar to each other and don't need a separate guide, feel free to put multiple achievement blocks below each other with a description after the final one.

For achievement blocks, please copy the one you prefer from [this page](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/wiki/Achievement-Code-Blocks).
