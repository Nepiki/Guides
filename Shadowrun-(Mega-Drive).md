# Overview

### The achievements can be grouped into a few types.

- Story Achievements (these cannot be missed.)
- Side Quests (There are 2 side quests in the game. They can be attempted at any time in the game.)
- Shadowruns related
- Matrix related
- Other miscellaneous types (Like collect all contacts, buy specific items, etc.)

### General Roadmap / Walkthrough

- Any starting class is fine, it only affects the very early stage of the game. You can always hire companions to complement your team.
- Hire any shadowrunner for the short term, then sell their items for easy money.
- Buy the `Predator Pistol` and `Armor Jacket` as soon as possible.
- Try to raise your `Reputation` to 5, then buy the `Ork Armband` as soon as possible.
- Try to raise your `Electronics` to 5. Buy `Invisibility` (or hire `Ricky`) to repeat early Corp Runs from `Mortimer Reed`.
- If you are feeling adventurous, you can try to complete the `Stark` side quest and get him to join your party.
- Buy the contact from `Mortimer Reed`, and save up 20,000¥ and buy the `Lvl 5 Maglock Passkey`.
- Grind mid-level Corp Runs (from `Celeb` or `Julius`), and save up to buy the `Fuchi Cyber-5` Cyberdeck. You should have a full permanent party member by now, let them stay in party to earn karma for them too.
- Depending on your confidence level, either repeat the mid-level Matrix Run or the Renraku Corp Run from `Celeb` to earn money and karma while upgrading your deck.
- Focus on the Cyberdeck's `Response` and `Masking`. Once you are confident enough, start grinding high-level Matrix Run (from `Celeb`) for money and karma. You will need a lot of money and karma to complete all the achievements.
- Just grind the high-level Matrix Run until you are feeling confident to finish the main plot of the game. It is up to you whether to grind for all the achievements first, or finish the game first and come back. If you think the grind is too much, you could grind just enough for the most expensive item in the game (the `Fairlight Excalibur`), then just save-buy-load for the rest of the items.

# Story Achievements

You will earn these just by progressing through the story. With the exception of ***TWO*** special ones listed first.

### Special Story Achievements

Image | Descriptions  | Remarks 
----- | ------------- | --------
![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/72997.png) | **SLOT OFF, FRAG-FACE!!**<br>_Enter Matchsticks alone and unarmed and defeat Ito Ogami and his thugs using just your fists (hand razors and spurs are ok)_ | **:warning::warning: MISSABLE :warning::warning:**<br>Make a save before confronting him in the `Matchsticks`. Arm yourself with `Spurs`, dismiss all your companions, and then go in and punch everyone to death. Just load your game after that.
![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/73013.png) | **This One's Personal**<br>_Go to Elysia's Tomb alone and unarmed and defeat Thon and his thugs using only your fists (hand razors and spurs are ok)_ | This is the final boss, you can always reload the game after you beat him, so I wouldn't consider this missable. Get the `Spurs` if you do not already have it. Wear the best armor you can. Bring a full inventory of `Medkits`, and spam heal every time your HP drop below half. Having high `Body`, `Strength`, and `Melee Combat` is a must. Having high `Biotech` helps on healing. Maxing these stats will make it very easy.

# Matrix Side Quest

Below achievements requires you to log into Matrix systems, do some stuffs, and then crash the CPU. Most of them will require a pretty high-level decking capabilities, including a moderately upgraded Cyberdeck, a good decker, and some good programs.

I recommend starting these after you have at least
- The `Fuchi Cyber-5` Cyberdeck
- Max `Response` upgrade.
- At least 6 in your `Masking` upgrade.
- At least level 5 in your `Attack` and `Deception` program.
- At least 6 in your `Computing` skill (hiring `Rianna` is a good choice).
- Enough Cyberdeck memory to load `Attack`, `Deception`, and a `Tar Pit` fodder (Slow and Analyze).

Search online for more in-depth Matrix run strategies.

## Special Passcode

Image | Descriptions  | Remarks 
----- | ------------- | --------
![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/73033.png) | **Interrogating Him**<br>_Deck into Ito's matrix, obtain all interesting datafiles then crash the CPU_ | Passcode will be obtained during main story progression. Beware the first node contains a guaranteed `Tar Pit`, so get your fodder ready.

## Matrix Run

You can keep asking `Celeb` for Matrix run, accept them to store the system passcode, and then cancel them. The "interesting datafiles" are stored in various data stores, so just try to download at least once in every data store you encounter until you manage to "find nothing interesting". If you found something interesting, navigate to the CPU to crash it.
