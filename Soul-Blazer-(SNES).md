# 3) Walkthrough

[**Step 1: Dummy Step**](#step-1-dummy-step--total-points-999)

Here you can give a detailed explanation about every step, such as what the achievements are about, if there are any missables in this step, general tips to make sure every achievement is gotten in one run etc.

To make this header link to the section with these achievements, go to where the step is and hover over the header. A link icon should be visible on the left of the header, which you can right-click + copy and then paste where #step-1-dummy-step--total-points-999 currently is.

You can create as many steps as you desire. Recommended is to have one step dedicated to unmissable story achievements, while the others cover game-specific steps (like no-damage bosses, item collection etc.)

If the step has missables, be sure to make a bulletpoint list like below to inform the reader right away.

[Hitting Heavy Metal Mantis [m] (25)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/4868)

This boss may look intimidating, but it's actually really easy. The strategy is to hold the L or R button the entire time to hold out your sword for attacking. Then, go on either the left- or right conveyor belt and move close to attacking range when it's moving to the conveyor belt you're on. Get in a few poking attacks, two or three at most to be safe, then withdraw back to the platform behind you and move to the conveyor belt on the opposite side while making a pause at the middle belt to prevent it's fireball attack. Repeat the same strategy until it is dead.

[Stoning the Stone Lion Heads [m] (25)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/31331)
_Defeat the Stone Lion Heads without getting hit._
</pre></big>

This boss has two very easy phases, and a final one being a bit tricky to master.

- **Phase 1** - This head can only attack with a T-shaped fire breath in the four main directions. Therefore, standing either north-east, north-west, south-east, or south-west from it will ensure that you will never get hit. Just keep spamming the attack button and this phase will be over in no time.
- **Phase 2** - When you are standing at the position in the image below, this head will be unable to hurt you for the entire duration. If you still get hit, you are most likely standing too high. Make sure your bottom feet aligns with the bottom gray square.
- **Phase 3** - The toughest part about this phase is the setup. You will want to use the stone in the middle to influence its pattern, as it can only go in four directions so if you are on the north-eastern side while the head is on the south-western side, it will first go up and then right to reach you. It won't go to your exact position but instead a bit beyond, so the strategy here is to remain on one of the four corners practically glued to the stone, when it comes towards you attack it a maximum of three times, then it will continue its pattern at which point you have to influence it by heading towards another corner and then back to your initial position. I hope this explanation makes sense, but if you can't visualize it, [this video](https://youtu.be/-ECGpYoG5KY?si=ig4c9ZVNv6hGengh&t=42) demonstrates it well.

These two specific moles were rescued during the earlier two shrines.

[Flushing the Floating Skull [m] (25)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/31449)
_Traverse the Ghost Ship and defeat the Floating Skull all without getting hit._
</pre></big>

Ironically the hardest part about this fight is getting to the Floating Skull unharmed. Learn where the fish jump and stay far enough away from them, because the wood splinters will hurt you. The fires will only shoot out fireballs once you pass them, so keep that in mind. After a small tour you'll reach the hull, where you are always safe on the right side of it. The skull itself will go down every few second, attack it three times and then head back to the safe zone. The hands will die in one hit to magic, so make sure you have enough gems stocked up. Equipping the Power Bracelet will also be effective as it reduces the amount of hits necessary to kill the boss.

[Pushing Poseidon [m] (25)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/31468)
_Defeat Poseidon without getting hit._
</pre></big>

This boss is really easy to do. Like the first boss, you want to keep holding your sword in front of you with the L or R buttons. Then, depending on where he is:

- When he is in the middle, start all the way down so that you avoid his fireball attack from the trident, then walk up and remain in the middle of the boss' sprite. Keep standing there as the next fireball attack will miss you.
- When he is left or right, avoid the trident fireball attack by heading opposite of which hand the trident is in, then go to the middle of the boss' sprite. Again, remain where you are when he uses his fireball attack as they will miss you.

That's all there is to it. If you have trouble with the boss being on the left/right side, just focus on when he surfaces in the middle. If he is on the left- or right side while you remain in the top of the middle where you attacked him before he went underwater, he will be unable to hit you from there.
