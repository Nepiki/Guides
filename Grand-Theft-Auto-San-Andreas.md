**During the mission "Ryder", earn Ryder's respect with your new haircut**

**At the start of this mission, Ryder will make you drive to the barber shop and choose a new haircut. For this you need him to compliment your Hairstyle. You can sit there and try each Hairstyle, but if you want it the easy way, take a look at the pictures hanging on the wall, this MIGHT give you an Idea.**

 During the mission "Ryder", distract the cashier for the robbery with some reverse bowel movement

**So this one is probably more tricky to figure out. But after you get your haircut, Ryder will now tell you to go get some food. When you are buying food you need to eat so much that your stomach gives up on you.**
