[**Step 1: Chapter 1**](#step-1-chapter-1--total-points-64)

This step covers all the achievements that can be obtained during chapter 1 in chronological order of when you can first get them. There are a total of four missable achievements, though chapter two still allows you to revisit most of the places from chapter one, meaning that if you missed one, you can still get it then. There are only two real missable achievements to watch out for that can only be obtained during chapter 1:

- [Gingko Round Dance](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/197982) - Has to be done before reaching the capital for the first time.
- [Rookie Treasure Hunter](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/197989) - While it can technically be finished in chapter 2, it is recommended to do this before the end of chapter 1 due to the first area listed in the achievement becoming inaccessible after chapter 1 ends. The point of no return is upon finishing the Prayer Woods.

This chapter has a total of **two** Swordmaster books to collect. Be sure to get them as getting all books is a requirement near the end of the game.

**Chapter 1's point of no return is after the Prayer Woods.**

# 4) General Gameplay Tips

- Due to how the PlayStation Portable works, it is very easy to create multiple saves. Use that to your advantage!
- Use Mile's Steal ability frequently to save yourself some cash with getting items, as well as good gear. His stealing probability is pretty high, so you're almost always guaranteed to get something.
- You are at all times followed by a rabbit companion. It showing loving- or angry emotions can both be beneficial in battle, while it trying to get your attention means it found an item.
