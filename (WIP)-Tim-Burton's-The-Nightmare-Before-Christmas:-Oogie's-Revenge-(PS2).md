# 1) Introduction

Welcome to the RA guide for **Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge** for the PS2!

The game released in 2005 for PS2 and XBOX, developed by CAPCOM, and it proposes itself as a sequel to the 1993 movie, **Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas**. The game has some similiarity to **Devil May Cry**, like the combo ranking, level progression and secrets, although it is much easier to play.

The game takes place some time after the events of the film. Jack yet again gets bored of Halloween. He goes to Doctor Finkelstein for advice in how to improve the next halloween. The Doctor gives him his newest creation: SOUL ROBBER! A green slime that acts like a whip. Jack than decides to leave Halloween Town in search for new ideas, and leaves the Doctor in charge of the town. But Lock, Shock, and Barrel took this opportunity to revive Oogie Boogie, which then began his plot to take revenge, taking over not only Halloween Town, but all the other holidays too, to become the "Seven Holidays King". Sally manages to send a letter to Jack about what was going on, so he huries back to his town to fix the mess.

Most of the achievements requires the game to be played on Nightmare Mode, the highest difficulty possible in the game. The differences between difficulties are just a few: enemies have more health, dance segments require more precise timings, and more strict ranking requirements. It is possible to just play the game in Nightmare Mode, as this difficulty is actually manageable to play.

⚠️ The only supported version of the game is the european version. When playing this version, the game will ask you at what refresh rate, or video mode, to play the game. Only select 60Hz to be able to earn achievements, as 50Hz is not supported.

# 2) Overview

[**Progression**](#progression)

These achievements can't be missed and will be naturally unlocked by just playing the game.

***

[**Rank S**](#rank-s)

Most of these achievements will require you to get at least A Rank, as that's the requirement to be rewarded a figurine. While getting an overall S rank is required for [The Seven Holydays King](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/224865), and to also get the final costume for [Phantom Outfits](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/224860).

When you beat a level, the game will rank you based on different categories, and then give you a total rank of the level. The categories are:
* Time: how much time you spent to beat the level
* Combo: Highest combo number without breaking it
* Damage: Amount of hits taken (in nightmare difficulty, an extra point will be given per hit)
* Exclamation points: These points can be earned by taunting, using Santa Jack's presents, and in dance segments during boss fights

The game tracks the highest rank you earn in each of the categories, and it does not take into consideration the final ranking you earn in a level. With this in mind, if you're finding it too difficult to S rank on first visit, you can even revisit a level and go for just one or two of the categories for S rank, then again for the other two, and the game will assign you S rank for that level.

To get a total Rank of S, not only are you needed to earn all the S ranks, but to also complete the two hidden chapters. These chapters have no ranking, and just require to fully finish them to have them checked.

⚠️ It is not suggested to go after these hidden chapters while also going for S rank in their main chapters, as you're technically still in that chapter, and any hits taken or the time lost in these hidden chapters will be added to the main chapter's rankings. Plus, it is next to impossible to S rank completely the main chapter while also going for the hidden chapter (or at least it looks like it). They can be done any time anyway, even after beating the game.

[**Damageless, Full Combo**](#damageless-full-combo)

All of these achievements can only be done in Nightmare Mode.

Tips will be provided on how to avoid certain attacks and different strategies

***

[**Hidden Places, Collectables, Upgrades, Items**](#hidden-places-collectables-upgrades-items)



[**The Speedrun Before Christmas**](#the-speedrun-before-christmas)

This section will be dedicated to the achievement [The Speedrun Before Christmas](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/224866).\
This is put last as it makes it easier to do if you've beaten the game first. 

# 3) Tips

* **Combos** - Soul Spin (Full Rotation Left Stick, Square) is your best friend to get combos. Another suggestion to do more combos is to taunt an enemy (Directional Button) to make them more durable, especially if they're already damaged to make them replenish some health.
* **Taunt** - Taunt (Directional Button) is primarily used to get exclamation points, and it can be used repeatedly on the same enemy, even if they are already in Oogie Mode, to rack up exclamation points. You need to wait for them to finish their "startled" animation first before you're able to taunt them again.
* **Blue Souls** - Not only will they increase damage, but when using Soul Cycle (Triangle Charged), use a blue soul when you see the Soul Rubber becoming almost red to extended the move duration. This is very powerful when in enclosed areas full of normal size enemies.
* **Pumpkin King Costume** - While it is a powerful costume, with Fire Bomb (Triangle) doing very high damage, the costume is often used for puzzles and exploration, and it is better to conserve the Red Souls to avoid annoyance.
* **Dodge Extension** - Right after dodging (Circle), quickly change into any costume you have (L1 / R1) to have more invincibility. Normally, changing costume has you standing in place, but this gets cancelled out when done right after a dodge.

```
Smokin' Sexy Style!! [5]
Get a Pumpkin King Combo Rank for the first time [Dances don't count]
```
Perform a total combo of 150 without breaking it to reach **Pumpkin King** combo rank.

You'll have many opportunities to do this, but the easiest to do this is in Chapter 3. Continue until you're trapped in an arena fight with Shock. Perform Soul Cycle (Charged Triangle), and keep it going using Blue Souls before the Soul Robber becomes red (sometimes the enemies drop a Blue Soul too). When you run out of Blue Souls, keep the combo going by either hitting the enemies with a normal attack or with Soul Spin (Full Rotation Left Stick, Square).

If you've beaten the game, you'll have a general idea of how to progress through the game, making this achievement easier to do. If you didn't, wait until you're done with everything else, so that you'll be more prepared for this playthrough.\
Below i'll write different tips for each level and how to beat them the fastest way possible.

### General Tips
* You can, and must, play on easy mode for this achievement. Easy mode puts enemies on their lowest maximum health, making them faster to defeat.
* Cutscenes and pausing the game will not block the timer. The ranking screen, or the level select screen will block the timer however.
* You won't ever need to waste time to save in-game by speaking to Mr. Hyde. Only save at chapter end.
* You're not obbligated to fight most of the enemies in the game. It'll be written if some are obbligatory, but most of them you can just run away.
* Getting a good rank in each chapter means more souls to spend on upgrades, but it's ultimately not important.
* The only upgrades that you'll ever need are the Soul Robber and, maybe, the Pumpkin King costume upgrades. Santa Jack Costume will ever see usage only for progression.
* For most of the enemies, the normal Soul Robber combo (Square) will be sufficient to take care of most of the enemies as quickly as possibile. With the Halloween Ghosts and the King Ghosts it's better to use Soul Slam (Triangle), and with the Troll Skeletons and King Skeletons charge your Square and hit them from behind.

### Chapter 1
<details>

[![Speedrun Chapter 1](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/assets/133049176/09940d08-aa91-4b44-8d39-d6d3d81a1c90)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEQ3aKmckXk)

1. Fight the skeletons until Oogie Boogie starts to talk. It'll take you 6 skeletons.

2. The skeletons will continue to spawn endlessly until Oogie Boogie stops talking. Finish them off when he starts laughing.

3. Move immediately in the Town Hall to start the boss fight.

4. Hitting Shadow Oogie does lead to constant damage, but while hitting him, grab some notes so that you'll finish him off fast.

### Chapter 2

<details>

1. Talk to Corpse Kid. Optionally replenish your health at the fountain if needed. Then move to the Witches' Shop, which is nord of Corpse Kid.

2. It's unlikely that you'll have anything to buy, so after the cutscene, immediately exit. Talk to Corpse Kid again and enter into the manhole.

3. Defeat the enemies in her and talk to Clown. Then get out of the manhole through the grapple point.

4. Go to the entrance of Halloween Town, right in front of the fountain, and defeat the enemies that'll appear. Then interact with the gate.
