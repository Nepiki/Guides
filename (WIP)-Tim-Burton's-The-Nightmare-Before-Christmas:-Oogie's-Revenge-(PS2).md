# Introduction

Welcome to the RA guide for **Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge** for the PS2!

The game released in 2005 for PS2 and XBOX, developed by CAPCOM, and it proposes itself as a sequel to the 1993 movie **Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas**. The game strikes some similiarity to **Devil May Cry**, like the combat, the exploration and the rankings, all the while it keeps true to the artistic style of the film. It also features re-arranged music from the film, the is used either in the levels and combat, or during the dances agains the bosses to make them feel like duets. The game was also released alongside another game, developed by Tose, that features a story that takes place before the events of the film, **Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas: The Pumpkin King**.

The game takes place some time after the events of the film. Jack, yet again, gets bored of Halloween and wants something new, something scarier for the next one. He goes to Doctor Finkelstein for advice in how to improve Halloween. The Doctor gives him his newest creation: SOUL ROBBER! A green slime that acts like a whip, even capable of grabbing stuff with ease. Jack decides to leave Halloween Town with the Doctor's gift in search for new ideas, and leaves the Doctor in charge of the town. But Lock, Shock, and Barrel took this opportunity to revive Oogie Boogie, which then began his plot to take revenge. Taking over not only Halloween Town, but all the other holidays too, to become the "Seven Holidays King". When Jack comes back to his city, he notices that something was off in his town, and that the new inhabitants are not exactly friendly towards him.

⚠️ The only supported version of the game is the European version. When playing this version, the game will ask you at what refresh rate, or video mode, to play the game. Only 60hz is supported by this achievement set, so please be sure to select this option to be able to earn achievements

## Tips

* 

# Overview

[**Progression**](#progression)

These can be naturally earned by just playing through the game to completion.

It is suggested to start the game straight to Nightmare Mode to make the rest of the challenge achievements available to be unlocked, as they require this difficulty to be selected.

***

[**Rank S**](#rank-s)

This game features a ranking system based on your performance in a chapter. When you beat a level, the game will assign you a rank in each each of the four categories, then give you an overall ranking of the chapter. The game will also reward you souls based on what overall ranking you earned, up to 1000 souls.

The game will rank a chapter based on 4 categories:\
**Time**: how much time you spent to beat the level.\
**Combo**: Highest combo number reached.\
**Damage**: Amount of hits taken (in Nightmare Mode, you get 2 points for each hit rather than 1).\
**!-Count**: Earned by taunting, using Santa Jack's presents, and during dances by pressing the correct buttons right at the center of the indicator.

To earn the highest rank, S rank, you need to of course earn the highest amount needed by each of these categories. The amount depends on the chapter itself and the difficulty selected, with Nightmare Mode being the hardest ones to reach.

The game will keep track of the highest recorded ranks, and will assign you an overall rank of the chapter based on these recorded ranks, independently by what overall rank you got at chapter completion. This means that you can enter into a chapter and earn just one S rank, then earn the remaining S ranks at your pace, and when you got all the S ranks in said chapter the game will assign you an S rank for that chapter. It is possible to get all the S ranks in one go if you wish, and this is just something to keep in mind if some of these result too difficult to accomplish.

You're also needed to complete the 2 secret chapters in the game to beat the game with S rank. These secret chapters can be only in specific chapters, and do not have any ranking attached to them. Bear in mind however that you're still technically in the normal chapter while going for these secret chapters, and any time wasted or hits taken will add up to the ranking.

The achievement <code>The Seven Holidays King</code> requires beating the game with both Nightmare Mode and S rank. 

***

[**Damageless, Full Combo**](#damageless-full-combo)

Everything regarding defeating bosses without taking any damage or making full combos during Dance Mode will be treated here. These achievements can only be done in Nightmare Mode

Nightmare Mode doesn't change the behaviour of the bosses, but it does make them more tanky.

Dance Mode actually receives a noticeable change in Nightmare Mode: the indicator in which you have to press the buttons becomes smaller, requiring more precise inputs. On top of this,

***

[**Miscellaneous**](#miscellaneous)

Everything else like Items, Collectibles, Upgrades and Hidden Places, or that doesn't belong anywhere else, will be talked about here.

These achievements can be done along with the Progression portion of the set. Anywhere else, like the Speedrun achievement, is not suggested.

Items from the Witches' Shop get a price reduction if playing on Easy Mode. For consistency sake, the prices listed for anything that can be bought in the Witches' Shop will be the prices in Normal Mode and Nightmare Mode, as you're more likely to play with these difficulties anyway.

Easy Mode does have one item that is only available in this difficulty; the Pumpkin Shield. It makes Jack immune to damage, with each level extending this invincibility. This is not counted for **Sandy Claws**, but i'll still list the prices for that item anyway.

***

[**The Speedrun Before Christmas**](#the-speedrun-before-christmas)

This final part will be entirely dedicated to the speedrun achievement, **The Speedrun Before Christmas**.\
A mini-walktrough on what to do in each chapters will be written for each chapter to indicate what is exactly needed to finish a chapter, or to show a faster way to finish them. Technically speaking, if you get S rank Time, you should be fine anyway.

# Achievements

## Progression

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248483.png">

```
This is Oogie-Town [5]
Defeat Oogie Boogie's Shadow and recover the Halloween Door
```
`PROGRESSION`

He does nothing in particular except for moving the right and left. If he gets enough damage he'll teleport to the other side of the area and do this movement again. You can stand where he'll end up moving to make the most damage. His Halloween Ghosts aren't really worth your attention unless they are really close to you. You can just Soul Spin at them to dispatch them.

His only attacks are throwing dices at you with a twirl that also damages you if you're too close, and dropping giant dices on your head, which can also be dodged with the right timing, but you can just run in one direction to not be hit. These attacks are easy to predict because they're timed with the song. For example, the giant dices will drop on you after he sings the third "WOW".

After the fight you'll earn the Halloween Door.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248514.png">

```
Damcel in Distress [5]
Defeat the Mega Spider and recover the Valentine's Day Door
```
`PROGRESSION`

The fight will be mainly about hitting the weakspot on its back. The window of opportunity to hit it becomes even less the more health it loses, and you'll basically need to wait in between its attacks to attack it.

The spiderwebs won't deal damage, but will bind you to leave you open for any other of its attacks. Wait for these attacks at a distance while also standing on any of its sides. Wait for it by standing on its sides and then dodge it and move to its weakspot. Also stand a fair bit of distance to get ready for its charge and jump attack.

At half health, it'll start to shoot three projectiles at a certain rhythm; it'll shoot 2 in quick succession, then waits a bit and shoots the third. You can try to dodge the 2 projectiles while standing in any of its sides to apply the strategy for them.

If you hit its weakspot, or complete a dance successfully, the spider becomes many tiny versions of itself. Best way to deal with these is to, of course, hit them with Soul Robber. Level 2 Soul Robber is much more effective because of the wide attack that it gets. Charged Soul Spin will also do the trick as it'll also attract enemies to you to hit more of them.

After the fight you'll get the Valentine's Day Door and the key to Dr. Finklestein's Lab.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248515.png">

```
Cerebrum Cleansed [5]
Defeat Dr. Finkelstein and recover the St Patrick's Day Door
```
`PROGRESSION`

The only way to damage him is to throw the pieces of brain at him while his head is open. One way to open his head is to grab him from behind repeatedly until its head opens. Best moment to do this is right when the turrets retreat. Then throw the pieces of brain right in front of him to damage him. If you're not confident with this, collect the notes by destroying its inventions to open its head instead. Trying to open his head will also give a bit of notes too, so try to do this everytime he stops attacking to collect more notes.

He attacks in order, starting with the turrets. The turrets can be avoided by standing a bit further away from them, enough distance so you'll hit them. After the turrets, the blades will appear. They require some time to get ready giving you time to destroy one of them. Dodge them when they're activated while also damaging them to get notes. After the blades the turrets will appear again. At this point, if you destroyed his inventions you should have enough notes for the dance. If not, then he'll do one last attack with the electric pillar that shoots lightning that follows you around. Move around and don't stop until he's done. He'll then restart from the begining.

If you've done the Secret Chapter of Chapter 7, you should have the Sleeping Soup on your inventory. If you start the boss fight with this item in your inventory, the doctor will be asleep, letting you open its head for free damage. This won't work on Nightmare Mode however.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248516.png">

```
Thanks for Giving the Door [5]
Defeat Barrel and his Army of Skeletons and recover the Thanksgiving Door
```
`PROGRESSION`

Barrel will always run away from you while send Skeletons in your way. He also does attack by shooting you if far enough from you.

You can easily defeat him by stunlocking him with Taunts. Right after a Taunt perform a Charged Soul Spin, then immediately after Taunt again and repeat. Otherwise you need to catch him while he's running away.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248517.png">

```
Trick or Treat! [5]
Defeat Lock, Shock and Barrel and recover the Independence Day Door
```
`PROGRESSION`

Throw the bear traps and exploding pumpkins at them for some damage. Bear traps will also lock them in place, but they'll still be able to attack you. When the bathtub is destroyed, all three will get off to attack you. Of the 3, Shock is the most dangerous, as she can summon statues that will circle around you blocking your movement an leaving you open for attacks from the other 2. Lock and Barrel fight the same as like their other fights. Lock will try to plunge onto you from high above with a shadow that will tell you when to dodge his attack. Barrel will shoot at you from afar. They'll always announce their attacks so you'll know when they're gonna do them.

One very effective way to defeat them is to first destroy their bathtub right at the edge of the arena so the three of them won't get off far away. Immediately when they get off use Fire Blast from your Pumpkin King costume to blast all three of them at once up high in the air. When they fall down, wait for them to try to get up before using Fire Blast again to hit them. You can do this for as many Red Souls as you can, but remember to collect the notes to finish them off faster. If it fails, try to at least keep Shock occupied while keeping a look for the other two's whereabouts.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248518.png">

```
Boogeyman's Wager [10]
Defeat Oogie Boogie and recover the Easter Door
```
`PROGRESSION`

Stay close to the central platform and destroy the cards immediately as they appear. Get away from the platform a bit after destroying one of them or you'll get hit by the blades of the central platform.

The gunners can be destroyed and if done so will damage Oogie Boogie for a bit of damage. You can either go for them, or just go to the opposite side of the arena to not get hit.

After the gunners, the cards will appear again, minus the one you've destroyed earlier. After a while exploding dices will appear that need to be thrown away immediately.

The dices will appear again, except they won't explode immediately. At this moment Oogie will sing the "WOW" part of the song, and he'll have his mouth wide open whenever he sings "WOW". Throw the dices at him when his mouth is open and stay right on the empty spot where the dice was to avoid the explosions. After the third WOW, Oogie will explode and it'll be possible to damage him with Soul Robber.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248519.png">

```
A Dance of Fire and Ice [10]
Defeat the Fire King and Ice King Skeletons and recover the Christmas Door
```
`PROGRESSION`

Both the Fire King Skeleton and the Ice King Skeleton are basically bigger King Skeletons, so just like them the best way to defeat them is to attack them from behind.

Ice King Skeleton will go down very easily via Fire Blast from the Pumpkin King Costume. Don't use the costume against the Fire King Skeleton or it'll heal from it.

When either of them turns dark, use Santa Jack's Re-Possession present to turn them back to normal.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248520.png">

```
Father Christmas' Sorrow [10]
Defeat the Oogie Train to save Sandy
```
`PROGRESSION`

Make it a priority to hit the lever closest to where the train is coming from to not get it to Santa Claus. A red light will signal you which one it is that you need to hit.

The area is full of hidden enemies that make traversing anywhere a challenge. Either attack them at a safe distance or use a Re-Possession present on them.

While thashing the Oogie Train, remember to not stand in front of it or you'll take damage and be knocked down.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248521.png">

```
You're King Of Nothing! [25]
Defeat Mega Oogie and save all of the Holidays!
```
`COMPLETION`

You can hit his feet to make him fall (get away from where he falls!). This makes his head reachable with your attacks but be aware that staying on the ground makes it easy to be targeted by his attacks.

You can also get on the upper part of the arena and make him come closer to the gas leaks. When close, light them up with any attack from the Pumpkin King Costume for a good amount of damage. The gas leaks will reappear after a while.

He always makes a sound when ready to attack. If he's close, he'll try to smack you. It requires a precise dodge timing to dodge it, but you can also try to walk away from him if he tries. Another attack is him throwing up objects at you. It's sort of difficult to dodge this one because of how fast they'll fly at you. You'll have more possibility to dodge its attack the further away you're from him. You can also drop down the arena or get in the upper floor to make him stop the attack while he's executing it.

After the fight, you'll transition into a dance sequence. This one is the hardest in the game, and anytime you miss a button you'll lose health. The last parts in the dance are hard to do correctly, so they'll most likely cost you some health. As long as you have enough health to go through this, you'll be fine.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248701.png">

Jack's Return [5]
Get an "A" or higher in all Ranks in Chapter 1
```
`PROGRESSION`

S Rank | Easy | Normal  | Nightmare
--- | --- | --- | ---
**Time** | 10:00 | 10:00 | 8:00
**Combo** | 24 | 30 | 120
**Damage** | 4 | 4 | 4
**!-Count** | 24 | 30 | 30

**Time**\
If you don't waste any time going anywhere else besides the Town Hall after the initial fight and use some Blue Souls against Shadow Oogie you'll make it in time for sure.

**Combo**\
Don't use the first Skeletons that'll appear. Wait for the Skeletons that appear during Oogie Boogie's announcement. These ones will spawn quickly and indefinitely until Oogie starts laughing. Then combo them with Soul Spin, taunt them when low on health and repeat.

**Damage**\
Be careful of the Skeletons in Oogie Mode while going for combo. They get more reach with their attackt that can take you off-guard.

For the boss fight, refer to <code>Skellinton's Revenge</code> to learn more about it.

**!-Count**\
You don't need to taunt the enemies to get these. You can get these instead by doing a full combo on the dance with Shadow Oogie.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248563.png">

```
The Witching Hour [5]
Get an "A" or higher in all Ranks in Chapter 2
```
`PROGRESSION`

S Rank | Easy | Normal  | Nightmare
--- | --- | --- | ---
**Time** | 6:00 | 6:00 | 5:00
**Combo** | 16 | 20 | 100
**Damage** | 4 | 4 | 4
**!-Count** | 5 | 5 | 5

**Time**\
This chapter has only 2 obbligatory fights that you have to do to progress: inside the manhole (Hidden Place 1), and in front of the main gate. Everything else can be skipped for a faster time. 

The number of enemies that'll appear in front of the gate is actually random, but not really anything to be worried about.

**Combo**\
You can either use the enemies in the Hidden Place 1 or the enemies in front of the gate. The ones in Hidden Place 1 has enemies that can attack from a distance which can make getting to the combo requirement difficult. If that doesnt' work, the ones in front of the gate are more manageable.

**Damage**\
Be careful about the Skeletons that can attack from a distance. They can throw their bones even off-screen, and the ones in Oogie Mode throws them much faster. Soul Spin can redirect their attack if you hit it in time. You can also grab the skeletons and throw them at each other to control them better.

**!-Count**\
If you don't want a hard time, farm !-Counts in front of the gate. You can even do this in front of the Witches' Shop with the Skeletons, doesn't really matter.

The Hanging Tree [5]

**Combo** | 32 | 40 | 280
**Damage** | 4 | 4 | 4
**!-Count** | 24 | 30 | 30

**Time**\
Soul Cycle the Lock's fight to finish it faster. Remember to replenish its duration with Blue Souls before it becomes orange.

Knowing the location of the Hangmen beforehand can help a lot to finish this one faster. The map below can help with that.

Only real place where you can do that is in the Lock fight. Soul Cycle the enemies, and replenish its duration with Blue Souls, until the yellow skeletons appear. Interrupt Soul Cycle or let it finish and proceed to the usual method to get combos.

**!-Count**\
Right at the start of the Lock fight you'll be right in front of three Skeletons in range for your taunt. Spam taunt constantly against them until you reach the needed amount.

**!-Count** | 20 | 25 | 25

**Time**\
Exactly like Chapter 3. Only you can close the tombstones faster with a Soul Robber level higher than 1 to save time and not have the risk of accidentally dropping them.

Here's another map of their location.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/assets/133049176/7dfaa7f8-4c38-4143-8a4b-c1785d2bc9d5" width="600" height="450">
<p/>

If you're coming in this chapter the first time, you do have some time to get to the Witches' Shop to buy the Soul Robber upgrade (even some Blue Souls), as long as you do the tombstones in the initial area and, of course, you have enough Souls to buy it.

One thing to keep in mind for a better time: when you reach the other part of the graveyard, don't go near the tomb on top of the hill, the one right beside the spiral. Go instead for the one near the building full of spiderwebs and close it. Then go back to the one on top of the hill, defeat the enemies there and close that one. That'll make the enemies that were supposed to be there not appear.

**Combo**\
You'll encounter Skeleton Trolls in this chapter. These can be difficult to make combos out if you don't know how.\
They always roar before taking action, or right after getting taunted. You can stun lock them with taunts right when they finish to roar to make them unable to attack you. After a taunt, follow it up with about 2 hits (that are also powered up due to a successfull taunt), and when its about to finish roaring hit the taunt.

If you can't deal with the troll, there are also Skeletons that'll appear in the tombstone to the right of where you start the chapter in to get combos.

**Damage**\
You are vulnerable when trying to close the tombstones, so be quick in closing them.

In the second part of the graveyard you should see statues that blow fire. Just make sure to wait them out before proceeding.

The suggestion made in for the time rank can also be applied here to not deal with trolls and skeletons that throw bones.

**!-Count**\
Anywhere can work. Besides the Troll Skeleton, of course, as it requires a different timing to taunt it constantly compared to the normal Skeletons.

**Combo** | 47 | 59 | 59
**Damage** | 14 | 12 | 8
**!-Count** | 47 | 59 | 59

**Time**\
You just need to go straight to the building full of spiderwebs and into the boss fight. On your way, a Lock boss fight will start. Best way to deal with him is to go to him, taunt him, and Soul Spin him, and then repeat. If done correctly, you'll see his health drop rapidly.

You can't speed-up the boss fight, so just take any chances as they present themselves.

**Combo**\
The combo can be done through a perfect combo dance against the Mega Spider. The same applies with !-Count.

**Damage**\
You can maybe accidentally expose yourself to get hit by the Skeletons or Lock himself, but before the boss fight that's about it.

As for the boss, try to play it safe and take whatever opportunity you can get to hit its weakspot. Refer to <code>Arachnophobia<\code> to learn more about it.

**Damage** | 4 | 4 | 8
**!-Count** | 24 | 30 | 30

**Time**\
When entering the Doctor's Lab for the first time, you have to defeat the enemies and the guillotine to the right to get to the spiral. The Tricks and Treats are annoying to deal with because of their traps. Make sure to not be hit by the traps to now waste time.

Shock's fight can be done quickly with a Soul Cycle. If you don't have Blue Souls, make sure to have them before this.

Make sure to have 1000 Souls for the Biscuits also. You can get some souls by going to the left of the lever that deactives the electric gate in the Doctor's Lab, and going over the pipe all the way to the end. This is also a quicker way to get to the bridge.

**Combo**\
You can either use the Trick and Treats with the usual method, or Lock's Ghosts with Soul Cycle to reach the required amount. Ghosts with Soul Cycle is easier and saves more time, but it is up to you.

**!-Count**\
Trick and Treats are easy to lock with Taunts, just like with the Skeletons. Just repeatedly mash Taunts until done against them.

Ghosts are sort of difficult to Taunt due to them constantly moving away from you so don't even bother with them.

**Combo** | 8 | 10 | 90
**Damage** | 4 | 4 | 8
**!-Count** | 8 | 10 | 10

**Time**\
Do not go for the secret chapter, or else it'll be impossible to get an S rank in time.\
The Sleeping Soup won't give a noticeable time save against the Doctor eitherway.

When going to the Lab with a time limit, the stairs will be crowded with Trick and Treats, mechanical teeths and a Guillotine on top of the stairs. Keep your distances from the mechanical teeths and destroy them to not risk it. Guillotine's heads can be deflected with a Soul Spin. Getting hit by the heads can knock you down and waste some time.

When reaching the ramp, you can dodge the boulders with a well-timed dodge extended with a change of costume right after, but it still requires tight timing to do so. You should rather just hide from the boulders then trying that.\

**Combo**\
You won't have enough time to do combos while going for the door after deactivating the generator.

There's a much better place to do this without any hurry: after the boulders, go to the left and jump onto the spiral you'll find there. Enter the door to get to Igor's Room. In here you'll find Trick and Treats that you can use to do combos.

**Damage**\
Same thing with time applies here: watchout for the Guillotines, the mechanical teeths and the Trick and Treats, either in the generator's area or while going to the stairs.

Wait out for the boulders in the ramp before moving.

**!-Count**\
You can't taunt the statues or the guillotines, nor you would have time to do these with the timer while going for the stairs. Your best, maybe only place, is in Igor's Room at the end of the ramp.

Fun fact: this is very hard to do if you are trying to go for an overral S rank in one go.\
You can sort of make it in time with just dances, as long as you're fast enough to collect notes.

See **Cerebrum Cleanesed** for more information about the boss fight.

**Combo**\
This can only be done while performing a dance with perfect combo.

**Damage**\

**Combo** | 24 | 30 | 200
**Damage** | 4 | 4 | 8
**!-Count** | 12 | 15 | 15

**Time**\
You have to go from the Nightmare Lab to the Pumpkin Patch, right at the left of the main gate of Halloween Town. Though you may have some time to go to the Witches' Shop to get some upgrades here.

When you progress through the Pumpkin Patch, an announcement from Oogie shoul start. Normally continuing through this area where the announcement starts will make enemies appear, which includes Ogres and Phantoms. You can simply stand still and let the announcement finish to make no enemies or only some enemies appear to save some time.

**Combo**\
You can either use Igor's Room, right to the left of the Nightmare Lab, or use Hidden Place 2, on top of the Town Hall reachable using a spiral, to get to the needed amount of combos. Though you may as well use igor's Room since you start right in the Nightmare Lab in this chapter.

**Damage**\
This chapter will introduce the hidden enemies, right at the entrance of the Pumpkin Patch. You can try to dodge in time of their attack when they are revealed, though it is not so easy to get it right. It is more safe to just throw a Re-possession present at them to reveal them, but to also revert them to normal so that they won't do any cheap shots.

**!-Count**\
Igor's Room is a good option, as is the entrance of the Pumpkin Patch by throwing Re-possession presents at the hidden enemies, since you get !-points with them.

**!-Count** | 24 | 30 | 30

**Time**\
For being a maze, this chapter is very straightforward. Just hit the switches and proceed. One switch will require you to jump on a spiral to get through. After hitting that switch, jump onto the spiral to get back where you were and run all the way east until you get past a bridge to finish the chapter.

**Combo**\
I'm afraid you either have to use the Hidden Place 9, behind the waterfall (it has Ghosts, so it might be a bit annoying), or the Trolls that appear right in front of the bridge that ends the chapter. All else fails, you can go back to Halloween Town and get to Hidden Place 2 to get the neede combos.

**Damage**\
Avoid fighting the Trolls in your path, and mind the guillotine that is on top of the hill, close to the waterfall. Soul Spin if a head is close to you to redirect it to the guillotine.

**!-Count**\
Use the three Trolls that spawn in front of the bridge at the end of this area. Lump them together and then Taunt them. Wait for them to roar before taunting them again or they won't get startled.

**Time**\
They are not that difficult to take down. They're just beefed up King Skeletons after all.\
Ice King Skeleton can go down easily with a few Fire Blasts, while Fire King you'll have to hit it in the back with Soul Robber.

They will become dark, making them immune to damage, and you'll need to throw a Re-possession present to make them normal. It won't happen that frequently however.

**Combo**\
It's much better to try this when one of them is defeated. Then for the other that is still alive, just do normal combos at their backs

**Damage**\
Fire King Skeleton can be kept at bay with Fire Blasts because of him absorbing the damage, while also letting you damage Ice King Skeleton with high damage. You'll unfortunately have to deal with Fire King Skeleton the normal way.

You could use a Soul Spin powered up with a Blue Soul to deal the most hits on its back. Enough hits will make them drop the axe, meaning they won't be able to act if that happens.

Whenever you taunt or throw a present at them, they'll stomp on the ground, be aware of that. 

**!-Count**\
You can taunt them, but they'll become dark if you do that. After the taunt, you have to use a re-possession present to get !-points, also whenever they become dark by themselves.

The hidden enemies here WILL make you waste precious time. Avoid them or throw a present at them to turn them to normal to make them less annoying.

For the train either use Blue Souls or normal attack with the Pumpkin King Costume. Keep a bit of distance from the train or you'll be hit by it.

**Combo**\
Not that difficult to do. Either continuosly hit the train or use the enemies in the area.

**Damage**\
Use the Re-possession presents to reveal the hidden enemies and turn them to normal, to lower the risk of being hit. Also remember to not be too close to the train when trashing it.

The presents will cover this easily and safely from the hidden enemies.

Use the gas leaks whenever possible. In between getting to the gas leaks, or when they arent' available, you should also try to hit Mega Oogie with the Soul Robber powered with Blue Souls.

**Combo**\
Only way to reach this is to do a full combo of the dance. And the dance itself is the most difficult in the game, nevermind the fact that you'll need to repeat the first phase should you fail. Refer to <code>It's Payback Time!</code> to learn about the dance sequence.

**Damage**\
The best suggestions is to make use of the invincibility with the dodge extended, and to keep a certain distance. Of all his attacks, the one to be careful about is the throw up attack. Refer to <code>A Filthy Finale</code> to learn more about his attacks.

**!-Count**\
These can only be gotten by doing the dance, after beating Mega Oogie in the first phase.
You won't need to do the entirety of the song to get this amount.

Nightshade Froggy Worm [10]
Obtain the Sleeping Soup [Ch. 7 - Secret Chapter]
```

This Secret Chapter can be started by speaking to Sally at the Old Graveyard during Chapter 7.

She'll ask you to find 3 ingredients to make the Sleeping Soup: Deadly Nightshade, Worm's Wart and Frog's Breath.

The Deadly Nightshade is found in the hidden palace in the first area of the Old Graveyard. It's located down the path behind the big tree in the Old Graveyard. Go past the statues by destroying them with the pumpkins and then enter the open grave you should see to the right. Defeat the enemies inside to get the Deadly Nightshade.

The Worm's Wart can be bought by the Witches' Shop. Speak to the Witch to the right to buy one. You need 1000 Souls to buy it. If you don't have them, you could get to any Hidden Place close by to earn some, or defeat the hidden enemies at the entrance of the Pumpkin Patch.

The Frog's Breath requires Red Souls to get access to an area where you'll find it.\
Right before the stairs that'll take you to the Doctor's Lab, destroy the blocked entrance to the left with the Pumpkin King Costume and enter. Get to the elevetor that you should find on the left side of the area and go up. Bring the lantern to the left closer to the other two, then use a Fire Blast to light all three at the same time to disable the gate. You should see many frogs at the other side of the gate, but you're only interested in the one that emits a green breath. Find one of these frogs and wait for them to be closer. Move slowly to them and grab them with Triangle. If they run away, back off and wait for them to move closer to you. It may take some time to get one.

When you get all 3 ingredients, go back to Sally in the graveyard to finish the Secret Chapter and get the Sleeping Soup.

The Sleeping Soup has actual usage during the Dr. Finklestein boss fight. At the start of the fight he'll be put to sleep, letting you open his head and throw a brain piece at him for a free hit. This doesn't work on Nightmare Mode sadly.

Bony Cookie [10]
Help Igor get his Bone Biscuit back [Ch. 12 - Secret Chapter]
```

This Secret Chapter can be accessed by first speaking with the Dr. Finklestein, then to igor during Chapter 12.

Igor will tell you that his Bone Biscuits disappeared while he was eating them close to a manhole. The manhole in question can be found to the left of the entrance to the lab. You should notice a manhole rattling going this way. Interact with it and you'll get to a Hidden Place with a Mega Spider inside.

This Mega Spider is identical to the Mega Spider you've fought in chapter 5 so refer to <code>Damcel in Distress</code> to see how to defeat it.

After defeating it, you'll get the Bone Biscuits. Go back to Igor and give him back his Bone Biscuits to finish the Secret Chapter.

```
`CHALLENGE`

Watchout for the exploding pumpkins and hit their bathtub as hard as you can, while making sure you do so right at the edge of the arena so that they'll be close to each other when they get off to be hit easily by a Fire Blast.

You need to lock them down with Fire Blast to not have any issues in the second phase. It is much better if you have your Pumpkin King costume to level 3 so you have more Red Souls to use on them. Fire Blast them, wait for them to fall on the ground, then wait for them to get up and Fire Blast them, then repeat. Try to also collect the notes that they'll drop just in case you can't finish them with Fire Blast. To finish them off with the dance, you'd need for them to be at least 1/3 of the health bar.

I'm the Only Pumpkin King! [25]
Defeat Oogie Boogie without taking damage on Nightmare Mode
```
`CHALLENGE`

Be quick when destroying the cards. Level 3 Soul Robber full combo is enough to destroy them quickly. It will also move you forward a bit, so keep this in mind when moving away from the central platform.

Avoid the gunners. They're not worth it for how little they contribute and how risky they are.

For the exploding dices, you should throw 2 of them at Oogie Boogie to give yourself much more safe space from the explosions. They won't deal extra damage to him, but better safe than sorry.

Half-Cold Half-Hot [10]
Defeat the Fire King and Ice King without taking damage on Nightmare Mode
```
`CHALLENGE`

Fire Blast will stop the Fire King Skeleton from doing anything while the Ice King Skeleton gets destroyed making getting rid of it very safe.

Move behind the Fire King Skeleton when it is safe to do so and hit him with Soul Robber. Could Front MAY be used to let you get behind it, but you may as well pop a Blue Soul to finish it quickly.

A Filthy Finale [25]
Defeat Mega Oogie 1st Phase without taking damage on Nightmare Mode
```
`CHALLENGE`

Don't go for his feet. It makes you an easy target for his attacks. Especially the throw up attack will be harder to dodge. You'd also not be able to use the gas leaks to speed up the fight.

The fight is mostly the same. Just play it safely and make use of the invincibility extension to dodge more safely his throw up attack. If you feel like you can't dodge an attack due to being in disadvantageous placement, you can fall down or get in the upper part based on where you are to make his attacks stop while he's executing them.

`COMPLETION` `CHALLENGE`

This dance also has that same sequence as the earlier Oogie Boogie boss fight, but in here it is way harder than that. More specifically, the last 2 parts of the dance can caught you off guard if you're not ready.

Smokin' Sexy Style!! [5]
Get a Pumpkin King Combo Rank for the first time [Dances don't count]
```

Perform a total combo of 150 without breaking it to reach **Pumpkin King** combo rank.

You'll have many opportunities to do this, but the easiest to do this is in Chapter 3. Continue until you're trapped in an arena fight with Shock. Perform Soul Cycle, and keep it going using Blue Souls before the Soul Robber becomes red (sometimes the enemies drop a Blue Soul too). When you run out of Blue Souls, keep the combo going by either hitting the enemies with a normal attack or with Soul Spin.

## The Speedrun Before Christmas

```
The Speedrun Before Christmas [50]
Beat the game in 3 hours or less [New File, Save File Timer, Any Difficulty]
```
`COMPLETION` `CHALLENGE`

It is suggested to first be done with everything else, or at least beat the game once. That way we'll get some familiarity with the game and get an idea on how to progress.

Here are some suggestions to take into consideration before tackling this playthough.
* It is suggested to play in Easy Mode to make the enemies less tanky to save time.
* The timer moves through cutscenes and pause menu, but also during the the ranking screen and the save game screen. Skip through every cutscene, and make sure to not spend too much time on any screen.
* Do consider saving after finishing a chapter. Not only to save the progress made, to also in case you need a re-do with certain chapters for a better time.
* Some fights are obbligatory to progress, either because the way will be blocked or because you'll be unable to use the spirals if enemies are nearby. It'll be noted if a fight is obbligatory.
* The only upgrades that you'll ever need are the Soul Robber's and the Pumpkin King Costume. You can consider the Re-possession present upgrades if you feel the need for them.
* It's not necessary to go after the Crystal Skulls, but you may go after some fast and easy to get Golden Pumpkins to extend your life bar.
* Consider getting some S ranks in each chapter. They'll reward you 1000 Souls which does make getting upgrades quicker and eliminates the need to go out of your way looking for Souls. Playing in Easy Mode decreases the prices for all the items in the Witches' Shop so you won't even need that many Souls.

Below is a mini-guide on how to get through the chapters with some tips sprinkled here and there.

***

<details><summary>Chapter 1 - Jack's Return</summary>

**[Town Square - Fountain Area]**

Fight the 3 skeletons, and the next 3 skeletons that appear right after.

When Oogie Boogie begins his announcement, the skeletons will continue to spawn endlessly until he starts laughing. When he laughs, immediately defeat the skeletons.

After the cutscene, move immediately in the Town Hall to start the boss fight.

**[Town Square - Town Hall]**

**[Boss Fight - Shadow Oogie]**

Use your Blue Souls and hit him constantly with your Soul Robber. You should then be able to finish him off with a dance.

After the fight, you'll get the **Halloween Door**.

</details>

***

<details><summary>Chapter 2 - The Witching Hour</summary>

**[Town Square - Town Hall]**

Talk to Corpse Kid. Then move to the Witches' Shop north from where you are. Enter the door to the shop ignoring the enemies.

**[Town Square - Witches' Shop]**

It's unlikely that you'll have anything to buy so after the cutscene immediately exit.

**[Town Square - Town Hall]**

Run back to the fountain and talk to Corpse Kid again. Then interact with the manhole, entering Hidden Place 1.

**[Town Square - Hidden Place 1]**

Defeat all the enemies in here. Talk Clown, then exit the area by jumping to the spiral.

**[Town Square - Town Hall]**

Go to the gate and defeat all the enemies that should appear. Their numbers are actually random here, but it's not actually relevant.

After defeating all the enemies, talk with Clown.

</details>

***

<details><summary>Chapter 3 - The Hanging Tree</summary>

**[Graveyard - Tomb of Tears]**

Go past all the enemies and reach the big tree by following the path. Talk to the Hanging Tree, then go back to the graveyard entrance.

While getting here you'll start a fight with Lock's Skeletons. A goof way to dispatch them is with a Soul Cycle, replenishing it when needed with Blue Souls. You can also defeat them with a normal combo, as in easy mode they won't be that tanky.

After defeating them, interact with Zero's Dog house you should see near the graveyard entrance.

Now you need to find all 5 Hangmen scattered around the graveyard. You can use the following map to see where they're located. Though you still need to get to wherever Zero will indicate you to.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/assets/133049176/244bdbcf-bc54-4d6c-8366-5995b5a6adcc" width="600" height="450">
<p/>

In this part of the graveyard where you are, you'll find only one of them. After finding it, go to the entrance to the next part of the graveyard, which is where you started the Lock fight.

**[Graveyard - Old Graveyard]**

Here you'll find three of them. After getting to the last one, go back to **Tomb of Tears**.

**[Graveyard - Tomb of Tears]**

The last one is on top of the tree. When you are in front of the tree, go to the right to find a spiral. Jumping between the spirals, you should get to a branch where there are two spirals to jump to. The left one takes you to some souls, while the right one will take you to the Hand Man on top.

After getting to the last Hang Men on top of the big tree, get down from the tree and talk to the Hanging Tree.

A little funny thing to try: when you're at the top of tree to save the last Hangman, instead of dropping to the left, try dropping diagonally, down-left, in the direction away from the spiral. Dropping in this direction should make you fall into the Golden Pumpkin that's down there.

</details>

***

<details><summary>Chapter 4 - The Grave Danger</summary>

**[Graveyard - Tomb of Tears]**

Here's another map to give an idea of where they are.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/assets/133049176/7dfaa7f8-4c38-4143-8a4b-c1785d2bc9d5" width="600" height="450">
<p/>

You can close all the tombs found in the Tomb of Tears, and then make a quick stop to the **Witches' Shop** to get the Soul Robber upgrade. You can make it through this chapter and the next without the Lvl 2 Soul Robber, but it does make it easier in this chapter to lift up the tombs and the extra attack for the combo is a very nice addition.

After closing all the tombs here, move to the **Old Graveyard**.

**[Graveyard - Old Graveyard]**

When you reach this area, after closing the first tombstone, skip the next one and instead close first the tombstone next to the building full of spiderweb. Then go back and close the tombstone on the hill. This makes enemies not spawn saving some time.

After closing all the tombs here, get back to the **Tomb of Tears**.

**[Graveyard - Tomb of Tears]**

Go to the Hanging Tree and talk to him.

</details>

***

<details><summary>Chapter 5 - The Crypt Creeper</summary>

You need to get to the building on the other side of the graveyard, the one full of spiderwebs you should've seen while rescuing the third hangman.

While going there, you'll be stopped by Lock and his skeletons. Faster way to deal with him is to Taunt him immediately and Soul Spin in his face. Then immediately Taunt and repeat until he's defeated.

Go inside the building and follow the path to the boss. Refer to <code>Damcel in Distress<\code> for learn how to defeat it.
</details>

***

<details><summary>Chapter 6 - The Doctor's Hunch</summary>

Go straight to Halloween Town and then the to the Doctor's Lab, on the right of the manhole in which you entered back in Chapter 2. Use the key to the door and enter.

Go sout, then east. Defeat all the enemies and than jump onto a spiral you should see in front of the tube. Break the wooden blockade with the Pumpkin King Costume (Fire Blast destroys it faster) and activate the switch behind it. Go on top of the tube to the right to get some souls and to get back to the entrance faster. Cross the bridge to start a cutscene with Igor.

Exit the Doctor's Lab and go to the Witches' Shop to start a fight against Lock's ghosts. You can get rid of them faster with a Soul Cycle, without even a worry about the Blue Souls since you're right in front of the Witches' Shop!

Exit Witches' Shop and go to Corpse Kid in front of the fountain to take the quiz for the biscuits. If you're interested in the Golden Pumpkin you can get for perfect score, do not get a perfect score the first time you take the quiz or you won't be able to get it later on. Also the first time he'll always have the same questions so you can definitely get ready beforehand to make this easier.

Once you get the Bone Biscuits, go back to Igor and talk to him

<details><summary>Chapter 7 - The Lightning Round</summary>

Even if it true that the Sleeping Soup makes the boss fight against Dr. Finklestein faster, the Secret Chapter is a huge waste of time for just a tiny time save. It is not suggested to go for it.

Right at the start, go forward a bit and destroy the wooden blockade to your right with the Pumpkin King Costume. Destroy the traps to make the next part easier, then go through the electric gates and destroy the debris to make way to the generator.

Immediately after you destroyed the generator, go south-west to exit the area. Go south, then west and take the elevator that takes you back to the entrance of the area. Get to the lab by going north and avoid all the traps and enemies in the area. Soul Spin the heads that come out of the Guillotine on top of the stairs to send them back at them rather than just attacking it. 

You can easily dodge the boulders with the dodge trick with the right timing. If you are unable to do so, after jumping to the first spiral, if you continue to climb you won't need to jump the next spiral. Continue a bit and hid into the door nearby to avoid the incoming boulder. After that, jump the spirals and wait inside the doors to avoid the boulders. Some of them are blocked by wooden planks that can be destroyed with a Fire Blast.

After reaching Lock on top of the ramp, get into the elevator.

<details><summary>Chapter 8 - Changing Brains</summary>

For more information about the boss, refer to **Cerebum Cleansed**.

Of course, we want to be fast here. At the start, throw the pieces of brain in front of him so that they drop on the ground right in front or near him. Get behind him, destroy the turret to the left, and open his head. Then go immediately for the brain piece and throw it at him in front.

The next part requires you to be fast enough to pull it off. Destroy the blade to the right and behind him with a Fire Blast to give yourself more maneuverability. Get behind him, but stand a bit to the left to not be hit by the blade that'll come your way. After opening his head, go for the throw before the turrets appear.

This may take you a fair amount of tries to get it right. You can otherwise just build up the dance meter if you find this complicated.

<details><summary>Chapter 9 - Pumpkin Patch Possession</summary>

To exit the lab quickly, go to the left where there's the door to Igor's Room and drop from the ramp that's right in front of the door.

Go through the Pumpkin Patch, through the passage to the left of the main gate.

Dodge and pray all the hidden ghosts in this area and proceed further. Then just defeat the enemies quickly and jump into the spirals until you've reached the end

<details><summary>Chapter 10 - Barrel's Maze</summary>

Hit the switch to the left, then go straight.

Hit the switch that is far away with the pumpkin then go through the trolls and the guillottine.

Continuing after the guillotine, jump into the spiral that you should see closeby and hit the switch there. Jump back, go south, a bit north and all the way east until you cross the bridge.

</details>

<details><summary>Chapter 11 - Peril in the Pumpkin Head</summary>

Jump on top of the pumpkin and enter the hole you'll find up there.

On the first floor, just defeat the skeletons as normal.

On the second floor, Soul Cycle for some damage and to bring the ghosts closer to you. Then either Soul Slam or combo them.

On the Third floor, there'll be enemies hidden. To the right there are skeletons, and to the left there are ghosts. Don't bother to reveal them with presents, you can just reveal them yourself by either walking and dodging into them or hitting them.

Against Barrel, stun lock him with taunts and Soul Spin until defeated.

<details><summary>Chapter 12 - Runaway Clown</summary>

If you need, triple jump on top of the stump for the Golden Pumpkin.

Go all the way back to Halloween Town. This is a good time to stop by the Witches' Shop to buy some upgrades.

Go to the left of the City Town Hall and open the gate with the key to get to the Residential Area. Stop the Clown with a Re-possession present, then talk to the Witch. You'll then have to go to the Doctor in his lab to ask him for a tool. After talking to him interact with his tool box on the left to grab one.

Go back to the Clown. Stun him with the Re-possession present and then use the tool on him.

<details><summary>Chapter 13 - The Vampire Brothers</summary>

The vampires won't appear until you read the letter they left behind in their house, so do that before looking for them.

Here's a map to give an idea of their location

![The Nightmare Before Christmas - Tim Burton's_SLES-53192_20231114173942](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/assets/133049176/36862d9a-65c5-4845-86d2-a570b2b593d3)

One is right outside their house, where you open the gate with Clown.\
The second and the third one are close by each other in the Towers of Torment. Going to the left of the Vampires' House past the gate, go through the path and take the left when possible. Proceed, and then take the stairs and jump onto the spiral. Here you'll find one of the bats in a very tricky area. The other one is found on the roof, by taking a spiral located to the left of this area.\
The fourth one is found in the Hidden Place 10. When you reach the Sewer Slums, go to where the wooden blockade are located and destroy them with the Pumpkin King Costume. Then go upstairs, defeat the King Skeletons and take the spiral to the north to be transported right in front of the entrance of the Hidden Place.

The vampires can be attracted with your presents to make it much more easier to catch them. You still need to at least approach them a little to be attracted by the present, and they'll also attract the other bats that we're not interested.

After getting all four yellow bats, return to their house and bring them into each of the coffins inside the house.

Chapter 14 - The Mayor's Madhouse

<details><summary>Chapter 15 - Rooftop Rumble</summary>

Use Blue Soul when you block the tub with a beartrap for more damage.

You can defeat all three of them really fast if you can constantly hit them with Fire Blasts. If you do it like this, you won't even need to dance.

Chapter 16 - The Grisly Gauntlet

***

<details><summary>Chapter 17 - Casino Clash</summary>

There's nothing much to do to speed this fight up. Outside of maybe detroying the gunners so they shoot Oogie and to use Blue Souls when it is possible to hit him after stunning him with the exploding dices, the fight will go just as normal.

**[Christmas Town - Xmas Tree Plaza]**

Move to the gate that has opened to the northern part of the area, near the carousel.

**[Christmas Town - Xmas Junction]**

**[Boss Fight - Train]**

Conserve Blue Souls here for Mega Oogie. Instead use your Red Souls to destroy the train quickly. Better to use the normal attack with square to do more constant damage to it.

Throw presents at the hidden enemies to turn them normal and make them less scary to be around.

<details><summary>Chapter 24 - Taking Out the Trash</summary>

**[A Filthy Finale - Holiday Trash Hill]**

If you need to, you can just go through the entrance to the north to get to [Town Square - Town Hall]. From there you can just get to the exit south to get to Witches' Shop. If you have Blue Souls you should be fine for the boss fight.

When you're ready, move to the hill to the left to start the boss fight against Mega Oogie.

**[Boss Fight - Mega Oogie, part 1]**

It's faster to make him fall by hitting his feet and wack his head in Easy Mode. Use a Blue Soul and hit his head with Soul Spins for massive damage. Repeat this until defeated.

**[Boss Fight - Mega Oogie, part 2]**

This dance will actually damage you if you miss notes so be aware of that if you have a low amount of maximum health.

Other than this, nothing much to say here.
