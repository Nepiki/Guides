# 1) Introduction

Welcome to the RA guide for **Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge** for the PS2!

The game released in 2005 for PS2 and XBOX, developed by CAPCOM, and it proposes itself as a sequel to the 1993 movie **Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas**. The game strikes some similiarity to **Devil May Cry**, like the combat, the exploration and the rankings, all the while it keeps true to the artistic style of the film. It also features re-arranged music from the film, the is used either in the levels and combat, or during the dances agains the bosses to make them feel like duets. The game was also released alongside another game, developed by Tose, that features a story that takes place before the events of the film, **Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas: The Pumpkin King**.

The game takes place some time after the events of the film. Jack yet again gets bored of Halloween. He goes to Doctor Finkelstein for advice in how to improve the next halloween. The Doctor gives him his newest creation: SOUL ROBBER! A green slime that acts like a whip. Jack than decides to leave Halloween Town in search for new ideas, and leaves the Doctor in charge of the town. But Lock, Shock, and Barrel took this opportunity to revive Oogie Boogie, which then began his plot to take revenge, taking over not only Halloween Town, but all the other holidays too, to become the "Seven Holidays King". Sally manages to send a letter to Jack about what was going on, so he huries back to his town to fix the mess.

⚠️ The only supported version of the game is the European version. When playing this version, the game will ask you at what refresh rate, or video mode, to play the game. Only 60hz is supported by this achievement set, so please be sure to select this option to be able to earn achievements

# 2) Overview

[**Progression**](#progression)

These can't be missed and will be naturally unlocked by just playing through the game. While doing these, you should also go for the Miscellaneous achievements, as this is the best opportunity to get them out of the way and to also get ready for the rest of the set.

Most importantly, you can decide to start on Nightmare Mode, the highest difficulty in the game. Despite the increse in difficulty, it is still manageable enough to get through the game. And besides, all of the challenge achievements will require this difficulty anyway.

***

[**Rank S**](#rank-s)

Most of the ranking achievements are about the A rank, as that's the requirement to be rewarded a figurine. Getting A rank is not that difficult, but getting S rank, especially on Nightmare Mode, does require you to go out of your way to reach their requirements. It needs to be done on Nightmare Mode for the The Seven Holidays King achievement.

More about how the ranking system works will be explained in The Seven Holidays King, and the A rank achievements will have written the requirements for S rank and some tips to get them. As long as you are at least close to the S rank requirements, you'll get the A ranks anyway.

***

[**Damageless, Full Combo**](#damageless-full-combo)

Everything regarding defeating bosses without any damage taken will be expanded with different tips to ease the challenges a bit. Nightmare Mode just makes it requiring more time to take them down with their increased health, so no behaviour changes fortunately.

Full Combos during the dance segments are also a part of this section. There's nothing much to say except for what to expect from them, but the buttons that are to be pressed are always the same, so at least the exact sequence for each dance will be written. Also, missing a button won't fail the damageless achievements if you were wondering.

***

[**Miscellaneous**](#miscellaneous)

Everything else like Items, Collectibles, Upgrades and Hidden Places, or that doesn't belong anywhere else, will be talked about here.

These achievements can be done along with the Progression portion of the set. Anywhere else, like the Speedrun achievement, is not suggested.

Items from the Witches' Shop get a price reduction if playing on Easy Mode. For consistency sake, the prices listed for anything that can be bought in the Witches' Shop will be the prices in Normal Mode and Nightmare Mode, as you're more likely to play with these difficulties anyway.

Easy Mode does have one item that is only available in this difficulty; the Pumpkin Shield. It makes Jack immune to damage, with each level extending this invincibility. This is not counted for **Sandy Claws**, but i'll still list the prices for that item anyway.

***

[**The Speedrun Before Christmas**](#the-speedrun-before-christmas)

This final part will be entirely dedicated to the speedrun achievement, **The Speedrun Before Christmas**.\
A mini-walktrough on what to do in each chapters will be written for each chapter to indicate what is exactly needed to finish a chapter, or to show a faster way to finish them. Technically speaking, if you get S rank Time, you should be fine anyway.

# 3) Tips

**Combos** - The most reliable way to increase your combo counter is to use Soul Spin. It does less damage and doesn't push enemies (as long as its not empowered), and it can reliably stagger enemies when done in quick succession to make it safe to use. Another idea is to taunt the enemies when they're low health to make them go into Oogie Mode, which will replenish their health and make them more durable for more hits.

**Dances** - You can earn !-points during the dances, but make sure that the buttons are pressed right at the center of the indicator. When done correctly, the game will mark them as "Good".

**Blue Souls** - Not only Blue Souls increase the damage you deal with Soul Robber, but it also extend the durability of your grabs, especially for Soul Cycle.

**Pumpkin King Costume** - While the Pumpkin King Costume has a very powerful attack, it is also used to progress through the levels. Remember to preserve some Red Souls so you don't get stuck.

**Santa Jack Costume** - Of the presents you can throw with the Santa Jack Costume, Scared Stiff and Re-Possession are the most useful. Re-Possession can turn enemies back to normal, and Scared Stiff lock enemies in place, especially effective against the Halloween Ghosts and King Ghosts that are hidden.

**Dodge Extension** - The Dodge has a tiny bit of invincibility that normally requires to be timed with precision to use. If right after Dodging, you quickly change into any costume, the invicibility from the dodge is followed-up by the invincibility from changing costume, pratically extending it.

**Infinite Red Souls** - Earning all the figurines in the game will reward you with infinite Red Souls for your Pumpkin King Costume. This is not really needed, but it can make some parts in the game easier.

```
This is Oogie-Town [5]
Defeat Oogie Boogie's Shadow and recover the Halloween Door
```
`PROGRESSION`

He does nothing in particular except for moving the right and left. If he gets enough damage he'll teleport to the other side of the area and do this movement again. You can stand where he'll end up moving to make the most damage. His Halloween Ghosts aren't really worth your attention unless they are really close to you. You can just Soul Spin at them to dispatch them.

His only attacks are throwing dices at you with a twirl that also damages you if you're too close, and dropping giant dices on your head, which can also be dodged with the right timing, but you can just run in one direction to not be hit. These attacks are easy to predict because they're timed with the song. For example, the giant dices will drop on you after he sings the third "WOW".

After the fight you'll earn the Halloween Door.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248514.png">

```
Damcel in Distress [5]
Defeat the Mega Spider and recover the Valentine's Day Door
```
`PROGRESSION`

The fight will be mainly about hitting the weakspot on its back. The window of opportunity to hit it becomes even less the more health it loses, and you'll basically need to wait in between its attacks to attack it.

The spiderwebs won't deal damage, but will bind you to leave you open for any other of its attacks. Wait for these attacks at a distance while also standing on any of its sides. Wait for it by standing on its sides and then dodge it and move to its weakspot. Also stand a fair bit of distance to get ready for its charge and jump attack.

At half health, it'll start to shoot three projectiles at a certain rhythm; it'll shoot 2 in quick succession, then waits a bit and shoots the third. You can try to dodge the 2 projectiles while standing in any of its sides to apply the strategy for them.

If you hit its weakspot, or complete a dance successfully, the spider becomes many tiny versions of itself. Best way to deal with these is to, of course, hit them with Soul Robber. Level 2 Soul Robber is much more effective because of the wide attack that it gets. Charged Soul Spin will also do the trick as it'll also attract enemies to you to hit more of them.

After the fight you'll get the Valentine's Day Door and the key to Dr. Finklestein's Lab.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248515.png">

```
Cerebrum Cleansed [5]
Defeat Dr. Finkelstein and recover the St Patrick's Day Door
```
`PROGRESSION`

The only way to damage him is to throw the pieces of brain at him while his head is open. One way to open his head is to grab him from behind repeatedly until its head opens. Best moment to do this is right when the turrets retreat. Then throw the pieces of brain right in front of him to damage him. If you're not confident with this, collect the notes by destroying its inventions to open its head instead. Trying to open his head will also give a bit of notes too, so try to do this everytime he stops attacking to collect more notes.

He attacks in order, starting with the turrets. The turrets can be avoided by standing a bit further away from them, enough distance so you'll hit them. After the turrets, the blades will appear. They require some time to get ready giving you time to destroy one of them. Dodge them when they're activated while also damaging them to get notes. After the blades the turrets will appear again. At this point, if you destroyed his inventions you should have enough notes for the dance. If not, then he'll do one last attack with the electric pillar that shoots lightning that follows you around. Move around and don't stop until he's done. He'll then restart from the begining.

If you've done the Secret Chapter of Chapter 7, you should have the Sleeping Soup on your inventory. If you start the boss fight with this item in your inventory, the doctor will be asleep, letting you open its head for free damage. This won't work on Nightmare Mode however.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248516.png">

```
Thanks for Giving the Door [5]
Defeat Barrel and his Army of Skeletons and recover the Thanksgiving Door
```
`PROGRESSION`

Barrel will always run away from you while send Skeletons in your way. He also does attack by shooting you if far enough from you.

You can easily defeat him by stunlocking him with Taunts. Right after a Taunt perform a Charged Soul Spin, then immediately after Taunt again and repeat. Otherwise you need to catch him while he's running away.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248517.png">

```
Trick or Treat! [5]
Defeat Lock, Shock and Barrel and recover the Independence Day Door
```
`PROGRESSION`

Throw the bear traps and exploding pumpkins at them for some damage. Bear traps will also lock them in place, but they'll still be able to attack you. When the bathtub is destroyed, all three will get off to attack you. Of the 3, Shock is the most dangerous, as she can summon statues that will circle around you blocking your movement an leaving you open for attacks from the other 2. Lock and Barrel fight the same as like their other fights. Lock will try to plunge onto you from high above with a shadow that will tell you when to dodge his attack. Barrel will shoot at you from afar. They'll always announce their attacks so you'll know when they're gonna do them.

One very effective way to defeat them is to first destroy their bathtub right at the edge of the arena so the three of them won't get off far away. Immediately when they get off use Fire Blast from your Pumpkin King costume to blast all three of them at once up high in the air. When they fall down, wait for them to try to get up before using Fire Blast again to hit them. You can do this for as many Red Souls as you can, but remember to collect the notes to finish them off faster. If it fails, try to at least keep Shock occupied while keeping a look for the other two's whereabouts.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248518.png">

```
Boogeyman's Wager [10]
Defeat Oogie Boogie and recover the Easter Door
```
`PROGRESSION`

Stay close to the central platform and destroy the cards immediately as they appear. Get away from the platform a bit after destroying one of them or you'll get hit by the blades of the central platform.

The gunners can be destroyed and if done so will damage Oogie Boogie for a bit of damage. You can either go for them, or just go to the opposite side of the arena to not get hit.

After the gunners, the cards will appear again, minus the one you've destroyed earlier. After a while exploding dices will appear that need to be thrown away immediately.

The dices will appear again, except they won't explode immediately. At this moment Oogie will sing the "WOW" part of the song, and he'll have his mouth wide open whenever he sings "WOW". Throw the dices at him when his mouth is open and stay right on the empty spot where the dice was to avoid the explosions. After the third WOW, Oogie will explode and it'll be possible to damage him with Soul Robber.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248519.png">

```
A Dance of Fire and Ice [10]
Defeat the Fire King and Ice King Skeletons and recover the Christmas Door
```
`PROGRESSION`

Both the Fire King Skeleton and the Ice King Skeleton are basically bigger King Skeletons, so just like them the best way to defeat them is to attack them from behind.

Ice King Skeleton will go down very easily via Fire Blast from the Pumpkin King Costume. Don't use the costume against the Fire King Skeleton or it'll heal from it.

When either of them turns dark, use Santa Jack's Re-Possession present to turn them back to normal.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248520.png">

```
Father Christmas' Sorrow [10]
Defeat the Oogie Train to save Sandy
```
`PROGRESSION`

Make it a priority to hit the lever closest to where the train is coming from to not get it to Santa Claus. A red light will signal you which one it is that you need to hit.

The area is full of hidden enemies that make traversing anywhere a challenge. Either attack them at a safe distance or use a Re-Possession present on them.

While thashing the Oogie Train, remember to not stand in front of it or you'll take damage and be knocked down.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248521.png">

```
You're King Of Nothing! [25]
Defeat Mega Oogie and save all of the Holidays!
```
`COMPLETION`

You can hit his feet to make him fall (get away from where he falls!). This makes his head reachable with your attacks but be aware that staying on the ground makes it easy to be targeted by his attacks.

You can also get on the upper part of the arena and make him come closer to the gas leaks. When close, light them up with any attack from the Pumpkin King Costume for a good amount of damage. The gas leaks will reappear after a while.

He always makes a sound when ready to attack. If he's close, he'll try to smack you. It requires a precise dodge timing to dodge it, but you can also try to walk away from him if he tries. Another attack is him throwing up objects at you. It's sort of difficult to dodge this one because of how fast they'll fly at you. You'll have more possibility to dodge its attack the further away you're from him. You can also drop down the arena or get in the upper floor to make him stop the attack while he's executing it.

After the fight, you'll transition into a dance sequence. This one is the hardest in the game, and anytime you miss a button you'll lose health. The last parts in the dance are hard to do correctly, so they'll most likely cost you some health. As long as you have enough health to go through this, you'll be fine.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248701.png">

```
Jack Must Die! [25]
Beat the game on Nightmare Mode

You'll earn this after beating chapter 24 on Nightmare Mode.

That wasn't so bad... right?

```
`COMPLETION`

Refer to **The Seven Holidays King** for more information.

You're likely to earn this, along with the other ones, if you didn't complete the secret chapters when beating the game. You can always do them at your leisure, even after beating the game.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248703.png">

```
The Seven Holidays King [50]
Beat the game with an overall "S" ranking on all levels and successfully complete both
secret chapters on Nightmare Mode
```
`COMPLETION`

When you beat a level, the game will rank you based on different categories, and then give you a total rank of the chapter.
* Time: how much time you spent to beat the level.
* Combo: Highest combo number without breaking it.
* Damage: Amount of hits taken.
* !-Count: These can be earned by taunting, using Santa Jack's presents, and during dances by pressing the correct buttons.

The overall ranking in a chapter is determined by the highest ranking in each of the categories. It is not based on just the final ranking you achieve at the end of the chapter through the ranking screen, but rather the highest recorded rank reached in any category. Say you got S ranks in Combo, Damage, and !-Count, but D in Time; Replaying that chapter and earning S rank in Time will add it up to the other S ranks you already got to give you an overrall S rank in that chapter.\
An overall rank S of the game also requires completing both the Secret Chapters. These have no rank requirements themselves, they just require to be completed.

The achievement also requires to earn these S ranks on Nightmare Mode. The requirements for the S rank differ based on the difficulty, with Nightmare Mode being the most strict one.\
These requirements and how to reach them will be written in each of the A rank achievements

Be aware that if you are going for the Secret Chapters, any hits taken or any amount of time spent in these secret chapters will count for the rankings in the main chapters, as you're technically still inside it. If you're going for the Secret Chapters while also going for S ranks, know that at least the Time rank is almost impossible to do in both chapters.

Jack's Return [5]
Get an "A" or higher in all Ranks in Chapter 1
```
`PROGRESSION`

S Rank requirements:
* Time: 8:00
* Combo: 120
* Damage: 4
* !-Count: 30

If you don't waste time anywhere else, like saving the game or going into the Hidden Place, and go straight to Oogie Boogie's Shadow, you won't have any problems with time. Remember to use your Blue Souls against Shadow Oogie for more damage.

Bundle the Skeletons together and Soul Spin them until less than half health. Then Taunt to get them into Oogie Mode (you may need to hit them right after to keep the combo going) and Soul Spin again for even more combos. You should also defeat one Skeleton earlier, so that when the transformed ones are defeated you can hit this one while you wait for the others to spawn.

You can constantly taunt the Skeletons to get many exclamation marks. Otherwise, just do a Full Combo dance against Oogie Boogie's Shadow to get the exact amount needed.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248563.png">

```
The Witching Hour [5]
Get an "A" or higher in all Ranks in Chapter 2
```
`PROGRESSION`

S Rank requirements:
* Time: 5:00
* Combo: 100
* Damage: 4
* !-Count: 5

This is a short chapter, as long as you ignore any fights in town. The only fights you're needed to do is the one in the sewer and the one in front of the gate after speaking with the Clown in the sewer. The number of enemies in front of the gate can be at random, but not a problem at all.

Use the enemies in the sewer for combos. You could use Soul Cycle here, but it won't let you reach the 100 combo required, so just Soul Spin and taunt them. You can always use the enemies in front of the gate if unable to do it there.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248564.png">

```
The Hanging Tree [5]
Get an "A" or higher in all Ranks in Chapter 3
```
`PROGRESSION`

S Rank requirements:
* Time: 11:00
* Combo: 280
* Damage: 4
* !-Count: 30

Knowing the location of the Hangmen beforehand will be very useful here. Use the map below have an idea of where to go in case you forget.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/assets/133049176/244bdbcf-bc54-4d6c-8366-5995b5a6adcc" width="600" height="450">
<p/>

The Lock fight is the best and probably the only place where you can achieve the combo amount needed. Taunt the three skeletons in front of you, move to the left side of the area where you can see the barrier to the north and grab one of the skeletons to initiate a Soul Cycle. Whenever the Soul Cycle becomes orange, use a Blue Soul to replenish its duration. Do this until the Ogre Skeletons appear. Interrupt or let the Soul Cycle expire, than Soul Cycle the Ogre Skeletons until you reach the combo amount needed.

Other than this fight the only other dangerous place are the statues that spits fire in the other side of the graveyard. Just wait for them to spit fire and pass.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248565.png">

```
Grave Danger [5]
Get an "A" or higher in all Ranks in Chapter 4
```
`PROGRESSION`

S Rank requirements:
* Time: 7:00
* Combo: 100
* Damage: 8
* !-Count: 25

Use the map to know the location of each tombstones.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/assets/133049176/7dfaa7f8-4c38-4143-8a4b-c1785d2bc9d5" width="600" height="450">
<p/>

Its not necessary to do this, but you can try to buy the lvl 2 Soul Robber upgrade (you should have enough souls with the S ranks from the other chapters). But this can make the time ranking really difficult to reach. You can consider going through the level to buy it first, then retry this chapter with the lvl 2 Soul Robber to make time a non-issue.

The Skeleton Troll you'll find on your way to one of the tombstones is a good target for combos, although difficult to deal with if you don't know how. You can stun it with taunts to make it so that it doesn't act, but make sure to do this when it roars to land the taunt.

One thing to be aware: when you reach the tombstone that is on top of the hill in the other part of the graveyard, go instead for the tombstone close to the building full of spiderwebs. After that, go and close the one on top of the hill. Doing it like this makes the enemies not spawn, as long as you don't approach the tombstone on the hill.

```
The Crypt Creeper [5]
Get an "A" or higher in all Ranks in Chapter 5
```
`PROGRESSION`

S Rank requirements:
* Time: 9:00
* Combo: 59
* Damage: 8
* !-Count: 59

The Lock boss fight will most likely waste you some time here. If you get close to him fast enough, you can stun him by Taunting, then hit him with a Soul Spin and then repeat. Otherwise, catch him while in the air and engage the Skeletons only if they're too close. Lock will jump up in the air to attack you from above. If a shadow appears underneath you, dodge out of the shadow.

All the combo and exclamation marks can be done during the dance segment against the Mega Spider. Check **Damcel in Distress** for how to fight the boss. To speed-up the boss fight, remember to charge Square and then do a combo against the tiny spiders immediately followed up by Soul Spin for dealing the most damage.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248681.png">

```
The Doctor's Hunch [5]
Get an "A" or higher in all Ranks in Chapter 6
```
`PROGRESSION`

S Rank requirements:
* Time: 10:00
* Combo: 140
* Damage: 8
* !-Count: 30

The Trick or Tricks are a fair bit as evasive as the Halloween Ghosts, but can be really annoying to deal with due to their traps. Don't get too close to them, and make sure to destroy them from a safe distance. Remember that if they are about to be defeated, defeat one of them so that a new Trick and Treat spawns to not risk dropping the combo.

Another place to get the combo rank is against the Halloween Ghosts of Shock during her fight with the same tactic as the Lock's Skeletons fight. If you don't have Blue Souls, make sure to buy them at the start of the chapter.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248682.png">

```
The Lightning Round [5]
Get an "A" or higher in all Ranks in Chapter 7
```
`PROGRESSION`

S Rank requirements:
* Time: 6:00
* Combo: 90
* Damage: 8
* !-Count: 10

Do not go for the secret chapter, or else it'll be impossible to get an S rank in time. That and also the Sleeping Soup won't do anything to Dr. Finklestein on Nightmare Mode.

Make sure to know how and where to move during the generator part of the chapter. Getting to it is easy, but getting to the Lab's entrance can be difficult. When the timer starts, enemies, traps and guillotines will spawn to block your way. Make sure to avoid or destroy the mechanical teeths before they get you. The heads that come from the guillotines can be send back by attacking the heads, but it is safer to do so with a Soul Spin.

The boulders can be avoided with the dodge extension, but it requires a certain timing to do so and it might not be reliable. Just go through this part normally.

Now that you're in front of the elevator that'll end the chapter, go left into a spiral that'll lead you to Igor's Room. In here you'll find Trick and Treats to use for combos and !-Points without any sort of urgency.

```
Changing Brains [5]
Get an "A" or higher in all Ranks in Chapter 8
```
`PROGRESSION`

S Rank requirements:
* Time: 3:00
* Combo: 54
* Damage: 8
* !-Count: 54

Refer to **Cerebrum Cleansed** and **My Whip Will Slice You!** for more information about the boss.

Best suggestion is to go for the dance one time, and then trying to open his head by yourself. You need to do the dance at least once to get to the combo and !-Count requirement.

If you position yourself in front of the blade behind the Doctor, you should be able to aim at the blade in front of him. Hitting that blade will also make you hit the blade behind. This makes collecting notes faster, and you'll have enough time to destroy at least the blade behind you before it activates. This is however possible with Soul Robber Lvl 2, as Lvl 3 will deal too much damage, making less notes appear and in turn makes the bar slower to fill up.

Remember that you can just do the rankings one at a time if it is too difficult to do them. Even then, this may take a few tries.

Pumpkin Patch Possesion [5]
Get an "A" or higher in all Ranks in Chapter 9

`PROGRESSION`

S Rank requirements:
* Time: 7:00
* Combo: 200

Nightshade Froggy Worm [10]
Obtain the Sleeping Soup [Ch. 7 - Secret Chapter]
```

This Secret Chapter can be started by speaking to Sally at the Old Graveyard during Chapter 7.

She'll ask you to find 3 ingredients to make the Sleeping Soup: Deadly Nightshade, Worm's Wart and Frog's Breath.

The Deadly Nightshade is found in the hidden palace in the first area of the Old Graveyard. It's located down the path behind the big tree in the Old Graveyard. Go past the statues by destroying them with the pumpkins and then enter the open grave you should see to the right. Defeat the enemies inside to get the Deadly Nightshade.

The Worm's Wart can be bought by the Witches' Shop. Speak to the Witch to the right to buy one. You need 1000 Souls to buy it. If you don't have them, you could get to any Hidden Place close by to earn some, or defeat the hidden enemies at the entrance of the Pumpkin Patch.

The Frog's Breath requires Red Souls to get access to an area where you'll find it.\
Right before the stairs that'll take you to the Doctor's Lab, destroy the blocked entrance to the left with the Pumpkin King Costume and enter. Get to the elevetor that you should find on the left side of the area and go up. Bring the lantern to the left closer to the other two, then use a Fire Blast to light all three at the same time to disable the gate. You should see many frogs at the other side of the gate, but you're only interested in the one that emits a green breath. Find one of these frogs and wait for them to be closer. Move slowly to them and grab them with Triangle. If they run away, back off and wait for them to move closer to you. It may take some time to get one.

When you get all 3 ingredients, go back to Sally in the graveyard to finish the Secret Chapter and get the Sleeping Soup.

The Sleeping Soup has actual usage during the Dr. Finklestein boss fight. At the start of the fight he'll be put to sleep, letting you open his head and throw a brain piece at him for a free hit. This doesn't work on Nightmare Mode sadly.

Bony Cookie [10]
Help Igor get his Bone Biscuit back [Ch. 12 - Secret Chapter]
```

This Secret Chapter can be accessed by first speaking with the Dr. Finklestein, then to igor during Chapter 12.

Igor will tell you that his Bone Biscuits disappeared while he was eating them close to a manhole. The manhole in question can be found to the left of the entrance to the lab. You should notice a manhole rattling going this way. Interact with it and you'll get to a Hidden Place with a Mega Spider inside.

This Mega Spider is identical to the Mega Spider you've fought in chapter 5 so refer to **Damcel in Distress** on how to defeat it.

After defeating it, you'll get the Bone Biscuits. Go back to Igor and give him back his Bone Biscuits to finish the Secret Chapter.

Remember that the twirl he does when he throw the dices also damages you, so don't stay too close to him. His big dices are not a problem if you just run in one direction to avoid them.

If the Halloween Ghosts get to close to you, prioritize defeating them first.

```
`CHALLENGE`

You can't really speed-up this fight that much so be patient on this one.

Remember to keep a safe distance to give you enough distance to see what attack it'll do, and to stay on any of its sides to bait its spiderweb and get to its weakspot. When it'll start to shoot 3 spiderwebs, dodge the first 2, then put yourself in any of its side to do the strategy again.

`CHALLENGE`

Don't even think about doing this the quick way. If you don't know what you're doing, you're likely to be shot by the turrets or be hit by the blades.

To be as safe as possible, just build up the notes meter and rely on your dances to have his head open. You of course need to gather as many notes as possible, so don't forget to try to open his head for some notes.

You Faced My Rage [25]
Defeat Lock, Shock and Barrel without taking damage on Nightmare Mode
```
`CHALLENGE`

Watchout for the exploding pumpkins and hit their bathtub as hard as you can, while making sure you do so right at the edge of the arena so that they'll be close to each other when they get off to be hit easily by a Fire Blast.

You need to lock them down with Fire Blast to not have any issues in the second phase. It is much better if you have your Pumpkin King costume to level 3 so you have more Red Souls to use on them. Fire Blast them, wait for them to fall on the ground, then wait for them to get up and Fire Blast them, then repeat. Try to also collect the notes that they'll drop just in case you can't finish them with Fire Blast. To finish them off with the dance, you'd need for them to be at least 1/3 of the health bar.

I'm the Only Pumpkin King! [25]
Defeat Oogie Boogie without taking damage on Nightmare Mode
```
`CHALLENGE`

Be quick when destroying the cards. Level 3 Soul Robber full combo is enough to destroy them quickly. It will also move you forward a bit, so keep this in mind when moving away from the central platform.

Avoid the gunners. They're not worth it for how little they contribute and how risky they are.

For the exploding dices, you should throw 2 of them at Oogie Boogie to give yourself much more safe space from the explosions. They won't deal extra damage to him, but better safe than sorry.

Move behind the Fire King Skeleton when it is safe to do so and hit him with Soul Robber. Could Front MAY be used to let you get behind it, but you may as well pop a Blue Soul to finish it quickly.

A Filthy Finale [25]
Defeat Mega Oogie 1st Phase without taking damage on Nightmare Mode
```
`CHALLENGE`

Don't go for his feet. It makes you an easy target for his attacks. Especially the throw up attack will be harder to dodge. You'd also not be able to use the gas leaks to speed up the fight.

The fight is mostly the same. Just play it safely and make use of the invincibility extension to dodge more safely his throw up attack. If you feel like you can't dodge an attack due to being in disadvantageous placement, you can fall down or get in the upper part based on where you are to make his attacks stop while he's executing them.

Smokin' Sexy Style!! [5]
Get a Pumpkin King Combo Rank for the first time [Dances don't count]

Perform a total combo of 150 without breaking it to reach **Pumpkin King** combo rank.

You'll have many opportunities to do this, but the easiest to do this is in Chapter 3. Continue until you're trapped in an arena fight with Shock. Perform Soul Cycle, and keep it going using Blue Souls before the Soul Robber becomes red (sometimes the enemies drop a Blue Soul too). When you run out of Blue Souls, keep the combo going by either hitting the enemies with a normal attack or with Soul Spin.

Estus Flasks [10]
Get all the Crystal Bottles
```

You can only get one Crystal Bottle through the Witches' Shop for 5.000 Souls.\
For the other 2 Crystal Bottles, you need to exchange all 8 Crystal Skulls you can find throughout the game to the Witch to the left at the Shop to get them.

1. In Halloween Town, to the right of the gate, latch on the spiral to get to Hidden Place 4. Defeat all the enemies to get a Crystal Skull.
2. In the Old Graveyard, get to the second section of the graveyard. Continue until you can see a spiral to the north. Latch onto it and use the Pumpkin King costume to get rid of the spider web. Get inside to enter Hidden Place 6 where you can find the Crystal Skull.
3. In the Old Graveyard during Chapter 18, get on top of the big tree where you found the last Hangman to find a Crystal Skull.
4. In the Doctor's Lab, to the left of the elevator where it takes you to the boss fight with Dr. Finklestein, go left, latch on the spiral and enter the door to get to Igor's Room, where you'll find it there.
5. In the Doctor's Lab, after Chapter 8, go through the door a bit before the elevator, the one you it was blocked at first, to get to Sally's Room. You'll also find the Crystal Skull right there.
6. In the Residential Area, go to entrance to the left of the Vampire Brothers' House, then go al the way straight and fall onto the pit. Go south to see some wooden barricades, but instead go to the left and look for a breakable wall. Break the wall and go through the entrance to get to Hidden Place 11 to get the Crystal Skull.
7. In the Magma Maze, progressing through the area you should see the Crystal Skull in an unreachable area. Go back to the red moving platform and when possible move to the other platform that is held by a skeleton. Latch on the spiral on top to get to the Crystal Skull.
8. In Christmas Town, it's located in the Hidden Place 18, where you have to get the Candles for Chapter 22. At the entrance of Christams Town, go behind the building to the left and latch on the spiral to get on top of the building. Drop on top of the big present behind the train and wait until you see a spiral. Latch on this spiral to get to the Hidden Place 18. If you're in Chapter 22, you'll need to re-enter it after getting the Candles to get the Crystal Skull.

## The Speedrun Before Christmas

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248755.png">

```
The Speedrun Before Christmas [50]
Beat the game in 3 hours or less [New File, Save File Timer, Any Difficulty]
```
`COMPLETION` `CHALLENGE`

We just need to make it to the end of each chapter the fastes way possible. For this reason it is suggested to first be done with everything or at least beat the game once first.

To give an idea, the exact requirement for every time rank S all additioned together will put us 30 minutes away from the 3 hour mark. Making it to the end by giving absolutely no care about anything, except for the Soul Robber upgrades that we for surely will need, will give us a much lower time than this. 

**Tips**
* Easy Mode is suggested to make the enemies and bosses much faster to defeat.
* The timer moves through cutscenes and pause menu, but also during the the ranking screen and the save game screen. Skip through every cutscene, and don't spend too much time on any screen.
* Do consider saving after finishing a chapter. This is just in case you'd want to re-do the next chapter for a better time.
* Some fights are obbligatory to progress, even if it is just to jump on a spiral, as you can't do that if enemies are nearby.
* The only upgrades that you'll ever need are the Soul Robber's and the Pumpkin King Costume. You can consider the Re-possession present upgrades if you want.
* Crystal Skulls are not necessary, but you may consider picking some easy to get Golden Pumpkins if you wish more health. Like the one on the tree in the graveyard.
* Consider getting some S ranks to earn 1000 Souls for each of them. On Easy Mode they are much easier to do and won't waste as much time, or at least make you pull out your hair as much, as in Nightmare Mode.

Below is a mini-guide on how to get through the chapters, with some other tips to finish them faster.

***

<details><summary>Chapter 1 - Jack's Return</summary>

Fight the skeletons until Oogie Boogie starts to talk. It'll take you 6 skeletons.

The skeletons will continue to spawn endlessly until Oogie Boogie stops talking. Finish them off when he starts laughing.

Move immediately in the Town Hall to start the boss fight.

Refer to **This is Oogie-Town** for more information on how to defeat him.
</details>

***

<details><summary>Chapter 2 - The Witching Hour</summary>

Talk to Corpse Kid. Then move to the Witches' Shop, ignoring the enemies.

It's unlikely that you'll have anything to buy, so after the cutscene, immediately exit. Run to the fountain and wait for Corpse Kid to reappear. Talk to Corpse Kid again and enter into the manhole.

Defeat all the enemies in here and talk to the Clown.

Get out of the manhole and go to the entrance of Halloween Town, where you started on chapter 1, and defeat the enemies that'll appear. Then interact with the gate.
</details>

***

<details><summary>Chapter 3 - The Hanging Tree</summary>

If you have enough Souls, like about 2000, you can go to the Witches' Shop and buy the Soul Robber upgrade and some Blue Souls.

Go past all the enemies and reach the big dead tree by following the way to the left and talk to Hanging Tree. You can waste a bit of time getting to the golden pumpkin on the tree.

Then go back to where you entered this area to initiate a fight with Lock's Skeletons. Defeat all the enemies, then interact with the dog house of Zero, next to the entrance to Halloween Town.

Find the 5 Hang Men throughout the area. Use the map below to give yourself an idea of where they're located.

<p align="center">

<p/>

After getting to the last Hang Men on top of the tree, talk to the Hanging Tree.

A little funny thing to try: when you're at the top of tree to save the last Hangman, instead of dropping to the left, try dropping down-left, in the direction away from the spiral. Dropping in this direction will make you fall into the Golden Pumpkin that's down there. It's not easy to get it but it does save some time.

</details>

***

<details><summary>Chapter 4 - The Grave Danger</summary>

Go straight to the tombstones around the graveyard and close them up.

Here's another map to give an idea of where they are.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/assets/133049176/7dfaa7f8-4c38-4143-8a4b-c1785d2bc9d5" width="600" height="450">
<p/>

When you reach the Old Graveyard, after closing the first tombstone, skip the next one and instead close first the tombstone next to the building full of spiderweb. Then go back and close the tombstone on the hill. This makes enemies not spawn saving some time.

After closing all the tombstones, go back to the Hanging Tree to finish the chapter.
</details>

***

<details><summary>Chapter 5 - The Crypt Creeper</summary>

You need to get to the building on the other side of the graveyard, the one full of spiderwebs you should've seen while rescuing the third hangman.

While going there, you'll be stopped by Lock and his skeletons. Faster way to deal with him is to Taunt him immediately and Soul Spin in his face. Then immediately Taunt and repeat until he's defeated.

Go inside the building and follow the path to the boss. Refer to **Damcel in Distress** for more information on how to beat it.
</details>

***

<details><summary>Chapter 6 - The Doctor's Hunch</summary>

Go straight to Halloween Town and then the to the Doctor's Lab, on the right of the manhole in which you entered back in Chapter 2. Use the key to the door and enter.

Go sout, then east. Defeat all the enemies and than jump onto a spiral you should see in front of the tube. Break the wooden blockade with the Pumpkin King Costume (Fire Blast destroys it faster) and activate the switch behind it. Go on top of the tube to the right to get some souls and to get back to the entrance faster. Cross the bridge to start a cutscene with Igor.

Exit the Doctor's Lab and go to the Witches' Shop to start a fight against Lock's ghosts. You can get rid of them faster with a Soul Cycle, without even a worry about the Blue Souls since you're right in front of the Witches' Shop!

Exit Witches' Shop and go to Corpse Kid in front of the fountain to take the quiz for the biscuits. If you're interested in the Golden Pumpkin you can get for perfect score, do not get a perfect score the first time you take the quiz or you won't be able to get it later on. Also the first time he'll always have the same questions so you can definitely get ready beforehand to make this easier.

Once you get the Bone Biscuits, go back to Igor and talk to him
</details>

***

<details><summary>Chapter 7 - The Lightning Round</summary>

Even if it true that the Sleeping Soup makes the boss fight against Dr. Finklestein faster, the Secret Chapter is a huge waste of time for just a tiny time save. It is not suggested to go for it.

Right at the start, go forward a bit and destroy the wooden blockade to your right with the Pumpkin King Costume. Destroy the traps to make the next part easier, then go through the electric gates and destroy the debris to make way to the generator.

Immediately after you destroyed the generator, go south-west to exit the area. Go south, then west and take the elevator that takes you back to the entrance of the area. Get to the lab by going north and avoid all the traps and enemies in the area. Soul Spin the heads that come out of the Guillotine on top of the stairs to send them back at them rather than just attacking it. 

You can easily dodge the boulders with the dodge trick with the right timing. If you are unable to do so, after jumping to the first spiral, if you continue to climb you won't need to jump the next spiral. Continue a bit and hid into the door nearby to avoid the incoming boulder. After that, jump the spirals and wait inside the doors to avoid the boulders. Some of them are blocked by wooden planks that can be destroyed with a Fire Blast.

After reaching Lock on top of the ramp, get into the elevator.
</details>

***

<details><summary>Chapter 8 - Changing Brains</summary>

For more information about the boss, refer to **Cerebum Cleansed**.

Of course, we want to be fast here. At the start, throw the pieces of brain in front of him so that they drop on the ground right in front or near him. Get behind him, destroy the turret to the left, and open his head. Then go immediately for the brain piece and throw it at him in front.

The next part requires you to be fast enough to pull it off. Destroy the blade to the right and behind him with a Fire Blast to give yourself more maneuverability. Get behind him, but stand a bit to the left to not be hit by the blade that'll come your way. After opening his head, go for the throw before the turrets appear.

This may take you a fair amount of tries to get it right. You can otherwise just build up the dance meter if you find this complicated. 
</details>

***

<details><summary>Chapter 9 - Pumpkin Patch Possession</summary>

To exit the lab quickly, go to the left where there's the door to Igor's Room and drop from the ramp that's right in front of the door.

Go through the Pumpkin Patch, through the passage to the left of the main gate.

Dodge and pray all the hidden ghosts in this area and proceed further. Then just defeat the enemies quickly and jump into the spirals until you've reached the end

</details>

***

<details><summary>Chapter 10 - Barrel's Maze</summary>

Hit the switch to the left, then go straight.

Hit the switch that is far away with the pumpkin then go through the trolls and the guillottine.

Continuing after the guillotine, jump into the spiral that you should see closeby and hit the switch there. Jump back, go south, a bit north and all the way east until you cross the bridge.

</details>

***

<details><summary>Chapter 11 - Peril in the Pumpkin Head</summary>

Jump on top of the pumpkin and enter the hole you'll find up there.

On the first floor, just defeat the skeletons as normal.

On the second floor, Soul Cycle for some damage and to bring the ghosts closer to you. Then either Soul Slam or combo them.

On the Third floor, there'll be enemies hidden. To the right there are skeletons, and to the left there are ghosts. Don't bother to reveal them with presents, you can just reveal them yourself by either walking and dodging into them or hitting them.

Against Barrel, stun lock him with taunts and Soul Spin until defeated.

</details>

***

<details><summary>Chapter 12 - Runaway Clown</summary>

If you need, triple jump on top of the stump for the Golden Pumpkin.

Go all the way back to Halloween Town. This is a good time to stop by the Witches' Shop to buy some upgrades.

Go to the left of the City Town Hall and open the gate with the key to get to the Residential Area. Stop the Clown with a Re-possession present, then talk to the Witch. You'll then have to go to the Doctor in his lab to ask him for a tool. After talking to him interact with his tool box on the left to grab one.

Go back to the Clown. Stun him with the Re-possession present and then use the tool on him.

</details>

***

<details><summary>Chapter 13 - The Vampire Brothers</summary>

The vampires won't appear until you read the letter they left behind in their house, so do that before looking for them.

Here's a map to give an idea of their location

![The Nightmare Before Christmas - Tim Burton's_SLES-53192_20231114173942](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/assets/133049176/36862d9a-65c5-4845-86d2-a570b2b593d3)

One is right outside their house, where you open the gate with Clown.\
The second and third one are close by each other in the Towers of Torment. Going to the left of the Vampires' House past the gate, go through the path and take the left when possible. Proceed, and then take the stairs and jump onto the spiral. Here you'll find one of the bats in a very tricky area. The other one is found on the roof, by taking a spiral located to the left of this area.\
The fourth one is found in the Hidden Place 10. When you reach the Sewer Slums, go to where the wooden blocks are located and destroy them with the Pumpkin King Costume. Then go upstairs, defeat the King Skeletons and take the spiral to the north to be transported right in front of the entrance of the Hidden Place.

The vampires can be attracted with your presents to make it much more easier to catch them. You still need to at least approach them a little to be attracted by the present, and they'll also attract the other bats that we're not interested.

After getting all four yellow bats, return to their house and bring them into each of the coffins inside the house.
