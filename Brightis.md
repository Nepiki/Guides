1) Walkthrough

Hexsalkia Castle (Tutorial)

Elthard Village エルサードの町

**Dungeon 1: Grassland Ruins 草原の遺跡**

In the room with the invisible monsters attack the dark element (?) and insert a Key Element to the pedestal to make the monsters visible.

闇の光は魔物を強くする。闇の光を打ち砕く、キーエレメントの光で魔物を照らせ！
The glow of darkness strenghtens monsters. Shatter the glow of darkness and illuminate the monsters with the light of the key elements.

In the room with the 4 colored Key Element buttons you need to insert them in the correct order to enter the boos room.

日は海よりいずりし、紫の雲路は森へと帰る。
The sun leaves the sea, and the purple clouds return to the forest
