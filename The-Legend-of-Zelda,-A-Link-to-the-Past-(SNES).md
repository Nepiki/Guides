# 2) Introduction

The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past is an action-adventure game developed and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the third game in The Legend of Zelda series and was released in 1991 in Japan and 1992 in North America and Europe.

A Link to the Past focuses on Link as he journeys to save Hyrule, defeat the dark lord Ganon, and rescue the descendants of the Seven Sages. It returns to a top-down perspective similar to the original The Legend of Zelda, dropping the side-scrolling gameplay of Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. It introduced series staples such as parallel worlds and items including the Master Sword. 

A Link to the Past has a total of 109 Achievements worth 788 points. The achievement set has been created by Retro Achievement developers [dude1286](https://retroachievements.org/User/dude1286), [HenrySwanson](https://retroachievements.org/User/HenrySwanson) and [AntTanGames](https://retroachievements.org/User/AntTanGames), with an excellent revision by [suspect15](https://retroachievements.org/User/suspect15), [TheMysticalOne](https://retroachievements.org/User/TheMysticalOne) and [JAM](https://retroachievements.org/User/JAM). The set of achievements are mostly designed to be achievable by the casual player, with the no-damage achievements for the more hardcore players. The game also has multiple leaderboards, including minigames and no-hit runs.

# 3) Walkthrough

[**Step 1: Story Achievements**](#step-1-story-achievements--total-points-147)

All of the story achievements are not missable, and will come to you over time when beating the game. The guide has sorted them on the chronological order of getting them in-game.

[**Step 2: Collecting Achievements (2 missable)**](#step-2-collecting-achievements-2-missable--total-points-256)

This step will lead you through finding every item, upgrades, and every chest in the dungeons and overworld. Every item achievement will also list what the requirements are that you need before you can go out to hunt them, sorted chronologically as much as possible.

This step has two missable achievements:

* [Magical Shield (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/2294) - The Magical Shield needs to be upgraded in the waterfall next to Zora's domain rather than be bought in one of the shops in the Dark World.
* [Hit Hyrule Castle (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/312938) - The Castle becomes inaccessible after having beaten Agahnim in the Castle Tower.

[**Step 3: Boss Achievements**](#step-3-boss-achievements--total-points-240)

There are multiple achievements per boss that you fight in this game. Note that once you beat a boss, it will be gone forever and cannot be fought again, therefore making ALL of these achievements missable. It is recommended to copy your save file to the other in-game save slots before finishing a dungeon in case you need multiple attempts.

[**Step 4: Miscellaneous Achievements (9 missable)**](#step-4-miscellaneous-achievements-10-missable--total-points-145)

This section covers the miscellaneous achievements that can be done at most points in the game, but do keep in mind that there are a few missables here as well as three achievements that involve you having to skip entire parts of the game for later. If you want to master this game in as few playthroughs as possible, it is important to work around these achievements. I will describe what you need to prepare for in full in Section 4.

This step has nine missable achievements:

* [Lightning Link (2)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/313069) - This achievement needs to be done before obtaining the Master Sword.
* [Granny's Coming Alone For The Ride (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/313071) - This achievement needs to be done before obtaining the Master Sword.
* [Toppo the Line Thief (2)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/319722) - This achievement needs to be done before beating Agahnim in the Castle Tower.
* [Monkey Business (2)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/319715) - This achievement needs to be done while Kiki the Monkey is following you towards the Dark Palace.
* [A Cape Not Just For Titans (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/319721) - This achievement needs to be done before getting the Titans' Mitt from Thieves' Town.
* [It's a Trap! (2)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/319717) - This achievement needs to be done while the maiden is following you in Thieves' Town.
* [I Shoulda Saved the Others Too? Well Excuuuuuuse Me, Princess! (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/315755) - This achievement needs you to not defeat any of the Dark World bosses before having beaten the one from the very last Dungeon, Turtle Rock.
* [Jack of All Trades (25)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/313073) - This achievement needs you to not have upgraded the Master Sword to the Tempered Sword, which becomes possible after the fourth dungeon in the Dark World.
* [Link's Not Old Enough To Drink (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/314433) - This achievement asks you to not get a single Bottle before beating the game.

# 4) Tips and tricks (no spoilers)

* You can *technically* master the entire set in one playthrough with a lot of save back-ups (see the hint under this one), though I personally wouldn't recommend it as you'll probably not have as much fun actually enjoying the game that way. If you still want to, keep the following do's and don'ts in mind:
   * Do NOT get any bottles before beating the game.
   * Do NOT upgrade the Master Sword to Tempered Sword before having beaten Ganon's Tower.
   * Do NOT beat any Dark World bosses before having beaten the one from Turtle Rock, the seventh dungeon in the Dark World.
   * Do NOT defeat the first boss of the Dark World before having obtained the Light Arrows (requires fifth/sixth dungeon beaten). 
* Remember that the game has a built-in copy feature for save files, for a maximum of 3 slots. This can be especially useful if you want to keep a boss for later due to it being too tough, or if you want to do dungeons in a specific order as you can (kinda) do the Dark World dungeons in a different order than stated.
   * One such example is by getting the item from the dungeon, but not beating the boss yet. This way, you can keep the boss from the first dungeon in the Dark World alive and kill him last for example.
* By visiting the ice cave in the lower-right part of the Light World and charging into the fairy statue in the middle, a bee will fly out. This bee is special as it stays alive for longer, and will attack enemies for you when you store it in a bottle. This also works on bosses, and can in some situations be very effective.
* After beating the second dungeon in the Dark World, I recommend getting the item from the fourth dungeon in Thieves Town first. That way, you can lift up heavier stones and get a lot of items that will make parts of the game and no-damage bosses easier. For example, you can get your sword tempered and obtain the Magic Cape from the cemetery, which makes you invincible at the cost of magic points. Do keep in mind that both the Magic Cape and Cane of Byrna are NOT allowed for no-damage bosses.
* When taking damage from a boss, your best option is to use the magic mirror to teleport back to the entrance. Resetting the game will place you at a specific spot on the map, so you'd have to walk all the way back to the dungeon.

There are a total of 10 Treasure Chests to be found in the Hyrule Castle. Note that this is done over multiple visits.

Hyrule Castle: 3 chests

1. **Map** - On the mandatory road. Walk all around to the back of the castle and go downstairs to find the chest.

[Toying with the Red Knight (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/314001)
_Kill the Red Armos Knight of the Eastern Palace using only the boomerang and collect the Pendant of Courage._
</pre></big>

-=MISSABLE=-

Kill five of the six Armos Knights with arrows. You should be able to do this damageless by remaining in the south-east or south-west corner and just keep shooting. When the final one becomes red, damage it only with your boomerang to kill it. Just stand south of it and spam the boomerang as it is unable to come closer to you. It will take a lot of hits from the boomerang, so just keep spamming it.

[Bested Armos Knights (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/2285)
_Defeat all the Armos Knights in the Eastern Palace without being harmed._
</pre></big>

-=MISSABLE=-

**Recommendations: None. They can be harmed with a sword, but the arrows are definitely the better option here.**

The Armos Knights most likely won't give you too much trouble. Just stay in one corner (I prefer south-east) and keep shooting arrows till only one Armos Knight remains. Every Armos Knight dies within 3 arrows, so use that to your advantage. The final Armos Knight will jump around and try to hit you from above, but this shouldn't be too much trouble if you keep walking around away from his landing position.

[Worm Kebabs (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/314002)
_Kill the Lanmolas of the Desert Palace dealing all damage with arrows, then collect the Pendant of Power_
</pre></big>

-=MISSABLE=-

It takes four arrows to kill each Lanmolas, meaning that you need at the very least 12 arrows to subdue them all. It's important in this boss fight to keep your distance and aim correctly, as you can only shoot one arrow at a time and only the head will take damage, meaning the hitbox isn't as big as you might think. If you have aiming troubles, stay near the south wall and stand underneath a hole where a Lanmolas comes out. If it goes south, that's an easy hit. Trying to shoot 3 arrows through every Lanmolas and then finishing them off one by one may be a preferred method due to the final one spitting out eight rocks when resurfacing rather than four.

[Bested Lanmolas (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/2289)
_Defeat all three Lanmolas in the Desert Palace without being harmed._
</pre></big>

-=MISSABLE=-

**Recommendations: Ice Rod.**

Surprisingly one of the tougher bosses to no-damage since there isn't really an easy strategy, and I unfortunately don't have a lot of advice to give here either. The Ice Rod is a recommendation, but it won't necessarily save you--it will just do a bit more damage than your sword. The best advice I can give is to wait for the final Lanmolas to pop out and try to hit that one. The rocks they shoot out always go diagonally so take your time and be extra careful. Do keep in kind however, that the final undefeated Lanmolas will shoot out in eight directions. I definitely recommend keeping the Ice Rod for the final one to get rid of it easier. Patience really is key here, and should be your main priority.

_Defeat Moldorm in the Tower of Hera within 20 seconds. (Must have Fighter Sword, May Not Have Hammer)_
</pre></big>

-=MISSABLE=-

This is relatively tough and not advised to combine with the no-damage achievement, as you have practically no time to miss attacks and play it safe. The time will start running once you enter the arena, with a trigger and leaderboard time being available. Just fall down and retry if you are close to or surpass the 20 seconds. To gain an advantage, get Moldorm to roam near the entrance of the arena and slash with your sword when entering for a free quick hit. After that, observe what direction he goes into and go to the opposite side, then slash the tail once his full body starts moving. It is recommended to charge your sword to prevent easily falling down or taking damage. Once he starts moving quick and you are not in a good position, use the Pegasus Boots as that goes right through him, and then just slash for that final hit.

[Bested Moldorm (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/2314)
_Defeat Moldorm in the Tower of Hera without being harmed._
</pre></big>

-=MISSABLE=-

**Recommendations: None**

I unfortunately don't have much advice for Moldorm. The good thing about him is that he can't hurt you as long as you are charging your sword. The problem here isn't taking damage however, but falling down. Fortunately, falling down also means an easy reset, so you can try this boss over and over again. He definitely is an annoying boss, but he shouldn't really hurt you, so the achievement should be pretty easy to unlock. If the boss still gives you trouble, you can try pause buffering him by constantly opening and closing the menu until he is in a good position to strike.

[You Really Bug Me Out (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/314004)
_Defeat Agahnim in Hyrule Castle Tower without unsheathing your sword._
</pre></big>

-=MISSABLE=-

As the achievement icon and title hint at, you can only use the Bug Catching Net to reflect Agahnim's hits. Since the damage returned is always the same, this boss battle follows the exact same pattern as described in the no-damage achievement, and can very well be combined together. Do keep in mind that the Bug Net is slightly slower than the Master Sword.

[Bested Agahnim (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/2337)
_Defeat Agahnim in Hyrule Castle without being harmed._
</pre></big>

-=MISSABLE=-

**Recommendations: None.**

The worst part about Agahnim? Having to go through that entire dungeon again if you mess up. Joking aside, Agahnim isn't too bad of a boss. He has three different attacks, of which one is very easily predictable- and avoidable. Whenever he goes to the most northern-middle spot and does not follow you around the room, he will use a lightning attack that can be avoided by going to the left or right wall. The other two aren't as easily identifiable, but shouldn't pose too much trouble either. The red shot can be reflected with the sword (or bug net) right at Agahnim, and it's recommended to stand straight across him to make sure it hits. The other attack is a bit trickier, as it is a blue circle that goes into 6 directions upon hitting a sword or a wall. You can hit it and hope the shield protects you if one of the directions is towards you, but I personally found that to be a bit too RNG-heavy for my liking. Avoiding the blue circle is definitely my preferred option. Keep this up for a bit and Agahnim is down.

[Mallet and Skewer (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/314005)
_Crack the Helmasaur's face Shield using only the hammer, then deal the rest of the damage with a silver arrow._
</pre></big>

-=MISSABLE=-

Due to the necessity of the silver arrows, this achievement can no be attempted before having beaten the Ice Palace and Misery Mire, so get the hammer and leave the dungeon for later. You'll first have to deal with his face shield, which takes a total of 16 hammer hits. Once that is down, shoot one silver arrow and it's dead. Due to the first phase being more predictable/easier to avoid attacks due to him moving around slower, it may be favourable combining this achievement with the no-damage achievement.

[Bested Helmasaur King (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/2352)
_Defeat Helmasaur King without being harmed without using the Magic Cape or Cane of Byrna._
</pre></big>

-=MISSABLE=-

**Recommendations: Bombs. If you're keeping this boss for later, you can also bring an Upgraded Sword or the Light Arrows**

The Helmasaur King is an interesting boss: he's not too difficult, but you have to be careful at all times. I recommend getting rid of the shield by dropping/throwing bombs (I prefer the former), as his movements are pretty predictable. It only takes 4 bombs to get rid of the shield, while it takes 16 hammer hits. The Helmasaur King only has two attacks to worry about: the first is where he spits out a fireball, that turns into three fireballs that implode diagonally. For this attack, it's best to go to the wall that's farthest away so you can easily dodge them. The other is his tail attack, indicated by when the tail starts moving faster. This is actually easily avoidable by standing directly in front of him. The only thing you need to be careful about here, especially in his second phase, is that he starts moving again right after the tail attack ends. If he runs into you, that obviously counts as damage. You can also avoid this by going to the wall that's farthest away, but I find standing in front of him easier.

_Defeat Arrghus's final phase dealing damage only with the Ice Rod then rescue the maiden._
</pre></big>

-=MISSABLE=-

Defeat the first phase as you would do normally: stand on either the left- or right side of Arrghus, hookshot his puffs and slash at them. Once all are gone, he will jump and move around the room diagonally. Use the Ice Rod to deal damage four times, and the boss fight is over. This achievement can very well be combined with the no-damage achievement and shouldn't pose too much trouble.

_Defeat Arrghus without being harmed without using the Magic Cape or Cane of Byrna._
</pre></big>

-=MISSABLE=-

**Recommendations: None**

Arrghus is a really easy boss, but you still have to be careful. ONLY Hookshot the minions off of him from the left- or right side, as doing it from above or below him has the chance for the minions to go too far into your sprite, damaging you when they're travelling back. When he does his swirl attack, go to the exact opposite of the room as he can't reach you. When all of the minions are gone, charge up your sword and keep walking around to make sure he doesn't land on you. Arrghus only moves diagonally, so that should make his movements predictable. 4 charged sword attacks should end him for good.

[Oprah's Dramatic Gift Reveal (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/314007)
_Finish off Mothula with bees and then rescue the maiden._
</pre></big>

-=MISSABLE=-

It is recommended to keep this boss until you have obtained the Tempered Sword (not Golden Sword), but you can also do it with the Fire Rod. Hit it about three times with the tempered sword or five times with the Fire Rod, then let the Good Bee do the remainder of the work.

[Bested Mothula (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/2358)
_Defeat Mothula without being harmed without using the Magic Cape or Cane of Byrna._
</pre></big>

-=MISSABLE=-

**Recommendations: Good Bee, Tempered Sword (NOT THE GOLDEN SWORD, THIS IS BUGGED).**

Mothula is a tough boss, so it is recommended to use both your sword- and Fire Rod and alternate between the two depending on how safe you have you play it. Mothula uses his beam attack every two-three seconds, so the only time you should go in for a sword attack is right after the attack happened. After the sword attack, keep your distance and use the Fire Rod until he repeats the pattern. Remaining near the middle of the screen is always favourable due to the spikes from the sides moving slowly towards the opposite side of the screen. They do a little nudge before moving, so pause buffering may be something to consider if the boss gives you too much trouble.

[Cane You See Me Now? (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/314008)
_Defeat Blind using only the Cane of Somaria then rescue the maiden._
</pre></big>

-=MISSABLE=-

This cannot be done before progress has been made in Misery Mire, so keep that in mind before attempting this achievement. No matter the weapon, Blind will always need nine hits to be defeated, and this also applies to the Cane of Somaria. Put a block somewhere while you are on the opposite side of him, and when he is in good range, press the item button again to have the block explode. Depending on your skill with the Cane, this may be a very viable way to do the no-damage achievement as well. Remember to bring Magic Potions as well, and recommended is to have the magic meter halved by the Mad Batter as well.

[Bested Blind (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/2360)
_Defeat Blind without being harmed without using the Magic Cape or Cane of Byrna._
</pre></big>

-=MISSABLE=-

**Recommendations: Good Bee, 1-2 Magic Potions if using the Cane of Somaria**

Blind is a very chaotic boss and should be approached carefully. While the Good Bee is not a necessity, it can give you a bit more breathing space. Every phase takes three hits no matter what weapon you use, and after every phase an extra head flies through the screen shooting beams at you which, mind you, Blind with the cloth on is able to do as well. The other heads are definitely the most dangerous aspect though, so only go in for sword slashes when they are far enough away while also being able to dodge clothed Blind's laser. The Cane of Somaria may be a very viable option due to being able to keep your distance at all times.

[Kholdstare into the Flames (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/314009)
_Defeat Kholdstare in the Ice Palace using only the Fire Rod to damage it then rescue the maiden._
</pre></big>

-=MISSABLE=-

You will absolutely need to bring at least one, preferably two Magic Potions before attempting this achievement. Getting rid of Kholdstare's shield will already require the entire magic bar from the Fire Rod, let alone the three eyes moving around after the shield is gone. Fortunately the Fire Rod does good damage against the eyes moving around so this shouldn't take too much effort, just remember that there is an ice ball falling every two-three seconds that you need to dodge.

_Defeat Kholdstare without being harmed without using the Magic Cape or Cane of Byrna._
</pre></big>

-=MISSABLE=-

**Recommendations: Bombos Medallion, Fire Rod, 1-2 Magic Potions**

Upon entrance, use the Bombos Medallion immediately to get rid of Kholdstare's ice armour (unless you are also going for the boss challenge achievement, then just use the Fire Rod). From there, it really is up to you on how you want to beat him as Kholdstare isn't too difficult--you just need to beware of the falling ice every two-three seconds that fortunately is easy to dodge by just walking slightly diagonally. You can use the Fire Rod to do massive damage to the eyes, so be sure to do so. It will always double damage than the tempered sword, and you can keep your distance. The sword is preferable if they get close however, just to bump them back a bit.

_Defeat Vitreous's little eyes by damaging them only with bombs, kill the big eye with only arrows, then rescue the maiden._
</pre></big>

-=MISSABLE=-

Lay- or throw bombs just slightly in front of Vitreous for the most effective damage and when the big eye starts popping out, move to either wall furthest away from you to dodge the lightning attack. Repeat this until all the eyes are gone, after which the big eye will pop out. Just keep standing south of it and spam arrows as it will be unable to do anything.

_Defeat Vitreous without being harmed without using the Magic Cape or Cane of Byrna._
</pre></big>

-=MISSABLE=-

**Recommendations: Tempered Sword, Arrows**

The tempered sword will be your best friend unless you are also going for the boss-specific challenge to use bombs. If the latter, use the strategy described there. If not, stay in front of Vitreous and keep slashing at the little eyes. Once the big eye starts popping out, move to one of the walls currently furthest away from you and you should be able to avoid damage consistently. Do watch out for the little eyes that may come out at that specific time however; safety is more important than a quick kill. Once all the little eyes are defeated, stand south of the big eye and just keep spamming arrows as he will be unable to attack/come closer to you.

_Completely destroy the Trinexx's Fire Head with the Ice Rod, then completely destroy the Ice Head with the Fire Rod, then Hammer the snake to death._
</pre></big>

-=MISSABLE=-

This is a very magic-expensive achievement, so be sure to bring as many Magic Potions as you can. The elemental rods are a necessity to stun the heads, but they also deal damage even when they are stunned. Important to keep in mind is that you have to deal with the Fire Head first before ever doing damage to the Ice Head. Once both heads are gone, the snake will go around the room in a specific pattern, so use the hammer on the middle part 5 times for it to die.

_Defeat Trinexx without being harmed without using the Magic Cape or Cane of Byrna._
</pre></big>

-=MISSABLE=-

**Recommendations: Golden Sword, 1-2 Magic Potions, Fire and Ice rod**

This boss might look menacing, but it's not that bad. What you want to do first is getting rid of the ice head on the right. The head movements may be confusing at first, but if you have the Golden Sword you only need to hit it 3 times. You can hit 2-3 times per stun with the rod. If you do this flawlessly, you should be able to kill it before the main body attacks but if not, just back off for a bit as his only attack is very predictable: the head will lunge at you when the tail starts moving faster. This attack won't hit you if you keep walking in a straight line. After taking care of the ice head, repeat the same for the fire head. Once those are down, the snake will move around in a predictable pattern. Take large circles around it and when it moves slow preparing to turn around, go it for the hit. With the Golden Sword, this should only take 3 hits in total.

[Bringing a Hammer to a Magic Fight (10)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/314422)
_Defeated Agahnim in Ganon's Tower without using a sword or bug net._
</pre></big>

-=MISSABLE=-

The title of the achievement already hints at it, but you can only return Agahnim's magic by hitting it with a hammer. The hammer works the exact same as the Master Sword in this battle, so just keep reflecting magic until he inevitably dies. There are a total of three Agahnim's with only one being vulnerable so watch out for other attacks, though he is unable to use the lightning attack in this battle.

[Bested Ganon (25)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/2388)
_Defeat Ganon without being harmed without using the Magic Cape or Cane of Byrna._
</pre></big>

**Recommendations: Golden Sword, 1 Full Heal Potion (for resets)**

Ganon can only be damaged with either the Tempered or Golden Sword during his first few phases, as no other weapons have any effect. This means there is no safe way to play by keeping your distance, and instead I recommend going ham on him as soon as you fall down the hole. If you keep slashing him as much as you can, he will only use the trident throw attack once which is fairly easy to avoid as it will go in the direction where Ganon will teleport to. For the next fire attack, just be as far away from him as possible and it won't be able to hit you, but do beware of them turning into fire bats afterwards which can be annoying. After that phase is over, follow Ganon's teleports and hit him as quickly as possible to avoid his other fire attack, but if he still does use it, just move away as far as possible (but beware of the falling floors). The 4th and final phase is where it can get slightly tricky, and where you also need to be extra cautious. You need to light two beacons while Ganon is shooting a fire bat at you, so make sure to light them fast with the Fire Rod. When he's visible again, ONLY attack him when you know where exactly he will appear, and if you can hit him the moment he appears. If you're even a second late, he'll fire his bat at you which is hard to avoid when you're close to him. Hit him so he's stunned, fire a silver arrow at him and repeat this 4 times. Take your time for the final phase and you'll be just fine. If you do take damage, reset the game and drink a full heal potion as your health/magic bar won't be full upon restart to ensure you can try it again very easily.

</pre></big>

West of the Archery Minigame in the Dark World is where the digging minigame is located. Keep digging here as fast as you can until you have earned 100 rupees during a single run. As indicated by the description, make sure you have space for all of them. This depends on RNG, but 100 rupees shouldn't be too tough to get.

[Jack of All Trades (25)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/313073)
_Complete Ganon's Tower without ever entering while possessing a sword, exiting or dying. Must start and finish in one attempt, entirely swordless._
</pre></big>

-=MISSABLE=-

Before anything else, the only way to lose your sword temporarily is to have it tempered at the smithies. This means that you must beat all dungeons, then go to the smithies to get rid of your sword, and then enter Ganon's Tower. What you can do before entering this dungeon is obtaining the Light Arrows and as many hearts and bottles with medicine/fairies (not for revival use) as possible. While this might sound like a menacing achievement, it is very doable due to how powerful the arrows and hookshot are, as well as the elemental rods and Cane of Somaria depending on if you brought Magic Potions. Remember that you may not ever exit the dungeon or die, which will permanently void this achievement for you. For Agahnim, you must use either the Bug Net or Hammer to defeat him. If you are in need of healing, there is a convenient healing spot on the third floor after the bridge where you are barraged by cannons. Use the Pegasus Boots to charge off of the blocks to the south where a breakable wall if located, with many refreshing items inside.

For this achievement, you may not have picked up a single Bottle before defeating Ganon. Check "All Your Bottles Are Belong To Us" to see what locations you should avoid. This also means that during this playthrough, you will not have access to healing outside of enemy/pot drops, nor the revival of a fairy.

[Now You're Playing With Power (5)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/25154)
_Enter Chris Houlihan's secret room._
</pre></big>

While technically a glitch, being able to do this is fairly easy. There are a total of five ways to enter Chris Houlihan's room, which can all be found in the video below. Follow the most important steps (e.g. bomb blasts getting you off-screen or in a hole, charging into a specific tree or object) and you should be fine. There is no time limit so take your time replicating the steps. You only need to enter one of the specified entrances for this achievement to trigger.
