Hello there, I'm Nepiki! I'm a gamer who has an unofficial case of amnesia so I have an obsession with writing everything down so I don't forget about it! Joking aside, I do genuinely like writing, especially if it helps out other people. I don't have a lot of guides yet, but expect to see more pop up in the future!

For everything me related, here are some links you can check out:

# 2) Introduction

Wario Land II is the second game in the Wario Land series, or the third if you count the Virtual Boy release. This was also a launch title for the Gameboy Color, being one of the few games that came as a black cartridge, indicating that it could be played on both the Game Boy and Game Boy Color. For that reason, there are also two sets for this game. While I am talking exclusively about the Game Boy Color version today due to it having more achievements, this guide applies to the Game Boy version as well due to the similarity in achievements.

Wario gets some well-deserved rest after kicking out Captain Syrup in the first entry, but she was out for blood. She invaded Wario's castle with her troops and robs him of all the treasure he has. Wario, loving treasure more than his mother, isn't happy with this and immediately chases after her to get his well-earned treasure back.

This achievement set was created by [voiceofautumn](https://retroachievements.org/user/voiceofautumn), using the Game Boy achievements as a base and expanding upon it. Most of the achievements are earned naturally as you go for completion, but there are also some miscellaneous fun achievements to partake in for the full set.

# 3) Walkthrough

[**Step 1: Story Achievements (including alternate paths)**](#step-1-story-achievements-including-alternate-paths--total-points-80)

This covers the story of the game, as well as every alternate path to find. After beating the game for the first time, a stage select appears with an easy replay button, showing what stages lead to alternate exits. Don't worry too much about achievements for this part and just focus on having fun and beating the game, as nothing is missable. Do make sure to do every end-of-level minigame and also try to find every treasure to save time though.

[**Step 2: Power-up Achievements**](#step-2-power-up-achievements--total-points-14)

These will almost all come naturally as you're playing through the game, though some only appear at specific places and have to do with bosses. This part covers where the power-ups appear and what to do to trigger them.

[**Step 3: Hitless Boss Achievements**](#step-3-hitless-boss-achievements--total-points-60)

These achievements require you to do the bosses without taking a single hit. I recommend doing these on your first try (as ''losing'' does reset hit progress), or waiting with these until after you've completed the game, because you can instantly go to the boss by pressing (down + A) when the prompt is shown after selecting the stage.

[**Step 4: Miscellaneous Achievements**](#step-4-miscellaneous-achievements--total-points-225)

This part covers completion, coins, the infamous post-game time trial, and the post-game minigame.

_Defeat the Giant Snake_

Usually the first boss you come across (unless you took the alternate exit in 1-1 or 1-5), located in       
**Chapter 1:** One Noisy Morning        
**Story 5:** Defeat the giant snake      

Pretty straightforward boss, just keep jumping on his head and avoid getting bitten.

_Defeat Bobo_

Usually the second boss you come across, located in       
**Chapter 2:** SS Tea Cup      
**Story 5:** Defeat Bobo!!     

Yet again a pretty easy boss: wait in the right corner and jump on his head when he's low enough. Don't forget to duck when he uses the attack to lift you up, otherwise you'll lose.

_Defeat the Giant Bee_

Usually the third boss you come across, located in       
**Chapter 3:** Maze Woods      
**Story 5:** Defeat the giant bee!     

This one is slightly more difficult because of the stupid small bees coming out of the hives. Just keep running around and when they get lower, hit them from the side.

_Defeat Dunk in a Basketball duel_

Usually the fourth boss you come across, located in       
**Chapter 4:** In Town      
**Story 5:** Anyone for B-ball?     

One of my personal favourite boss battles in the game, you play basketball against a bunny with both you and your opponent being the ball. Jump on his head to turn him into a ball, and throw him up into the basket.

_Defeat Captain Syrup in Chapter 5_

Usually the fifth boss you come across, located in       
**Final Chapter:** Syrup Castle      
**Final Story:** The Final Battle!!     

This battle consists of two phases, with the first one just throwing the bombs back that Syrup throws at you. For the second phase, throw the bombs in the fire pillars when they are underneath her.

_Defeat the Mecha Goom_

This boss is part of an additional chapter. To access this, you have to go to the very first level and refuse to wake up. This can be done on a first playthrough, but it will take much longer before the game moves on. On an already cleared game, it will only take 5-10 seconds.

For this boss, you have to keep jumping over it until it slows down completely and is recharged by Syrup. During this recharging time, you can attack it from the front. Keep in mind that when it turns red, it will do a ground pound first that stuns Wario and will most likely cause your defeat if you don't jump beforehand. Hit it one final time and then throw it up to Syrup. 

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/181562.png) [Cave Explorer (5)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/161475)   
_Defeat the Cave Master_

This boss is part of an additional chapter. To access this, you have to go to the 5th level of Chapter 1 (the fight against the Giant Snake). Use a ground pound where an arrow of coins is pointing downwards, then keep going up and to the right until you reach a door. From there, just keep going right through destructible walls until you reach a new door, bringing you to the alternate exit.

Lure this boss to the edge of the arena and then jump over him and dash him from behind. Do this three times and the boss battle is over.

_Defeat the Big Kamukamu_

This boss is part of an additional chapter. To access this, you have to go to the 4th level of Chapter 2 (Drop the Anchor). In the second room of the stage, go down all the way until you reach the bottom left, where a wall can be destroyed by throwing enemies at it. Continue from there until you reach the skull-faced block.

When you reach the fourth level of this chapter, be sure to take the top-right door once you reach the cross-shaped room. The bottom-right door will lead to an alternate exit.

You have to hit this boss three times from underneath. Be sure to swim up top so he comes towards you, after which you can hit him.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/181564.png) [Aqua Man (5)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/161478)   
_Defeat Awabo_

This boss is part of an additional chapter. To access this, you have to go to the 4th level of Chapter 2 (Drop the Anchor). In the second room of the stage, go down all the way until you reach the bottom left, where a wall can be destroyed by throwing enemies at it. Continue from there until you reach the skull-faced block.

When you reach the fourth level of this chapter, be sure to take the bottom-right door once you reach the cross-shaped room. The top-right door will lead to a boss battle with Big Kamukamu.

Awabo will move diagonally through the screen, and you have to jump on his head three times. He'll spit out copies after every hit but they can't harm you, so ignore them.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/181565.png) [Factory Shutdown (10)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/161479)   
_Defeat Captain Syrup in the Mysterious Factory_

This boss is part of an additional chapter. To access this, you have to go to the 4th level of Chapter 4 (Escape from the factory). In the second room of the stage, go down right away and start ground pounding the purple blocks. One of them should be breakable and will lead you to the secret exit.

This battle will consist of two phases. With the first one, you just have to dash at Syrup's capsule until the glass breaks, after which she will throw remote bombs at you. Jump on the bombs and throw them back at her.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/181566.png) [Spider-Bat-Ghost (10)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/161480)   
_Defeat the Ghost in the Uncanny Mansion_

This boss is part of an additional chapter. To access this, you have to go to the 5th level of Chapter 4 (Anyone for B-ball?). Right next to the boss door is a wall that can be destroyed by throwing an enemy at it, which will lead you to the exit.

For this battle, keep running around so the ghost can't grab you when he drops straight down. If he goes down diagonally, only charge at him when you are in a good position, otherwise just duck.

_Defeat Bobo without getting hit_

Bobo is found in Chapter 2, Story 5. The best tactic for this boss is to just remain in the bottom-left corner and then jump on his head when he is approaching you. When he uses his whirlwind attack, just duck and you'll be fine. Remember that if you do get hit, just let the fight end itself for an easy retry.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/181796.png) [White Wario's Can't Jump (10)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/161470)   
_Defeat Dunk with a score of 3-0 without getting hit_

Bobo is found in Chapter 4, Story 5. Dunk has a single jumping pattern so use that to your advantage. When you can't jump on him, just jump into him and it's highly unlikely that you'll get damage. Do watch out for his little basketball he throws at you though, as that counts as a hit. Remember that if you do get hit, just let the fight end itself for an easy retry.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/181797.png) [Conqueror Of The Flaming Sea (25)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/161472)   
_Defeat Captain Syrup in Chapter 5 without getting hit_

The only thing you really have to watch out for in this fight is the rising fire that goes left/right by one pillar for the whole fight, and that when you throw a bomb on the ground, it unleashes two smaller fire pillars. Aside from that, just keep throwing the two spearmen back at her in phase two, and the bombs into the fire pillars when they are underneath her. Remember that if you do get hit, just let the fight end itself for an easy retry.

***

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/181794.png) [Mecha Short Circuit (5)]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/161474)   
_Defeat the Mecha Goom without getting hit_

This boss is found at the end of the alternative chapter when not waking up in the first level. The mecha goom runs around quickly at first so be prepared for that, but will slow down quickly. The first two hits are a repeat until he turns red. Be wary that he jumps and ground pounds, stunning you and most likely resulting in a hit. Wait till he slows down again and hit him from the front. Be wary of the thunderbolt Syrup shoots at you though. Throw the mecha goom at her and the fight is over. Remember that if you do get hit, just let the fight end itself for an easy retry.

***

_Defeat the Big Kamukamu without getting hit_

This boss is found at the end of the alternative chapter when taking the alternative exit in ''Drop the Anchor''. Stay high in the water at all times on the opposite side of Kamukamu. He will eventually swim towards you, which is the perfect time to dive and then rise to hit him from underneath. Do it three times and the fight is over. Remember that if you do get hit, just let the fight end itself for an easy retry.

_Obtain all treasure_

Every single level in the game has a door hidden somewhere in the level where you have to play a memory game. You need to collect a total of 50/100/200 coins in that level to get a chance at the minigame, going from hard to easy difficulty respectively. I personally recommend doing them on normal difficulty, but the choice is yours. Win it and the treasure is yours. After the game has been beaten once, you can see what levels you still need to get the treasure in (indicated by the treasure chest icon). It would take far too long for me to describe where every treasure is found, so just browse the [Mario Wiki](https://www.mariowiki.com/Wario_Land_II).

_Obtain all pieces and complete the Treasure Map_

Every single level in the game ends with a digit puzzle. From your total coin stack gathered across all levels, 50 are used to flip a tile. Keep flipping tiles until you are certain which number it's going to be. Win it and you get one of 50 pieces. After the game has been beaten once, you can see what levels you still need to get the treasure in (indicated by the empty block next to a level).

_Obtain 25 points in the Flagman D-D minigame without getting a single miss_

This minigame is unlocked after 100% completion. A remake of Game & Watch's Flagman, you have to mimic the moves portrayed by the duck pirate. He'll go in four directions at first (1 = up, 2 = right, 3 = down, 4 = left), after 10 waves the B button is introduced, and the A button 5 waves later. He'll start with just one direction which you have to mimic, then two, then three etcetera.

There's unfortunately not much advice I can give for this one; either you have a good memory or you don't. You have to get up to 25 points and not make a single mistake. Fortunately, the time after each press is pretty forgiving.

Frankly, if you have a bad memory like me, just write down what button you have to press after every wave. You can even pause the emulator while doing so.

_Clear the Really Final Chapter in under 6 minutes_

Easily the most difficult achievement in the game, but the most difficult achievement of this set is still pretty easy. This level is unlocked after getting all 50 Treasure Map Pieces. The level might look menacing at first, but there is an easy tactic to getting this achievement without too much sweat. But before I go into that tactic, allow me to describe every room first. If the written explanation does not suffice, using this [Video Footage](https://youtu.be/Z1-DV8_huik) should do the job.

**Room 1:** A ''maze-like'' room. Go close to the middle and ground pound your way down, then charge to the left and ground pound again to get to the bottom. Be wary of this end part though, as there is a snowman waiting at the end that you cannot avoid. A well-timed charge or a ground pound is required.           
**Room 2:** This room features three platforming challenges over water, with an annoying flying spike. The easiest way to get through these is by crouch-jumping; holding down on the D-Pad and then jumping. The most annoying part of this room really, is the ''stairway'' in the middle and at the end. I don't really have a tactic for this, but keep up on the D-Pad pressed in at all times when trying to jump to the higher level.     
**Intermission:** Pretty straightforward, just jump up and do a dash-jump to make it to the next room.            
**Room 3:** Go to the left instantly and grab the enemy. You need to carry him with you all the way to the end of this room, so keep holding the throw button and launch him forward in hallways where you are unable to carry him. In the final throwing section, throw him inside the small hallway, get near him, wait for him to get up and then bounce him towards the end of that hallway. The remained of this room is self-explanatory.    
**Room 4:** A platforming challenge where you have to bounce on spearmen to get to the end of the ledge. Don't throw the spearmen too far onto the ledge, otherwise you probably won't make the jump and grab them instead of jumping off of them. While trying to bounce on them, keep up on the D-Pad pressed at all times, and press the jump button just when you're about to hit the enemy.      
**Room 5:** The most annoying !@#$% room in the entire level. It's yet again another stairway that goes up for a long time. Yet again, have up on the D-Pad pressed up at all times and make your way up. I wish I had more advice, but you just have to get a feel for this.    
**Room 6:** One of the more easier rooms. Just lure the birds towards you and jump off of them to reach the next platform. If you made it this far, this shouldn't be an issue.    
**Room 7:** An entire room dedicated to a mechanic that is literally only used in this room. You have to charge-slide, meaning that you charge forward and then duck to make your way forward while ducking. This is also used at the end of this room over the spikes, though feel free to damage boost through them as you don't have to worry about coins in this level anyway.    
**Room 8:** Another relatively easy room. Just get flattened and then go up. At the first jumping challenge, get near the edge and do a jump without having the up on the D-Pad pressed in.      
**Room 9:** The boss! This might look tricky at first, but there's a pretty easy tactic to it. Ground pound on the goom on one side, then jump up high on the other side of the goom, repeat until he's dead.

Now, you may have trouble getting beyond that 6-minute mark in one run. I'm here to tell you that... you don't have to do it in one run. After you've done a room, just use the save button in the select screen, as it will save your progress in the level. Then, proceed through the next room and if you feel it's going terrible, just reset the game and start at the save point again. The achievement will unlock after the stage is done with less than 6 minutes on the timer.

_Collect 999 coins in a single level_

To my knowledge, it is impossible to get 999 coins in a single level by only collecting the coins. You are forced to kill enemies and hope for silver coins, which are worth a total of 100. Fortunately, enemies do respawn upon re-entering the room, so use that to your advantage.

Silver coin spawns aren't very high, so I recommend doing the stage ''Don't Shock The Owl'', which is in the factory alternative chapter. Getting every single coin in this level should net you about ~700 coins, so at that point you only have to grind for 2-3 silver coins. There's a spearman near the end of the level, so keep re-entering that room and kill him for a chance at the silver coin.

After completing the game and getting pretty much every other achievement, you'll have about 2000-3000 coins most likely, probably a bit more. Not a bad amount, but you'll need a lot more.

There are arguably better levels out there for getting all coins, but I found the first level in the game to be the most time-efficient. It only takes 2-3 minutes to beat this level, and you can get 500 coins at the very least by doing the entire level and finding all secrets. Most levels in the game allow you to get a nice stack of coins, but this one is the quickest to do. Don't forget to kill every enemy that's on your path and destroying every block for the chance of a silver coin, which makes the grinding a bit more bearable.
