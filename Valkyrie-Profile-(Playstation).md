## The guide /!\ WIP /!\

Written by [Sines](https://retroachievements.org/user/Sines), don't hesitate to ping me if you see mistakes in this guide. 

This guide is an extended and more explicit version of what was initially my routing notes. Everything has been personally tested by me and should be replicable by following the notes. **This is not a play-by-play walkthrough**, the goal is to cover all the achievements, provide a roadmap to obtain them and give tips & tricks to save on time.

# 2) Introduction

<p align="center">

</p>

Valkyrie Profile is an RPG loosely inspired by Nordic mythology where you play as a Valkyrie tasked to retrieve the souls of dead warriors in preparation for the Ragnarok. Due to the premise, this mean that every single one of your companion in the game will die before joining you, often in terrible ways, and you will be here to watch it happen. Fun times !

The gameplay loop is a mix of exploration, with a bit of platforming, and classic RPG turn based battle with a twist. While fighting, each of your 4 team member is assigned to a right-side button X O □ ∆ and will attack when you press their symbol. It's up to you to mix & match your lineup and pay attention to their move and timing to be able to juggle and combos enemy, filling a special gauge that will then let you unleash devastating Super unique to each character. There are of course a few more systems but I'll cover them in due time. 

# 3) Walkthrough

While technically you don't need to do two full playthrough if you are already familiar enough with the game, I'd recommend to do the set in 2 playthroughs. The first one in Normal mode for the Ending B and the second one in Hard mode for the Ending A. You totally can switch which ending for which difficulty you want to tackle and a lot of the regular Normal mode dungeons are also available in Hard mode but I'll present the achievements with that order in mind.

Also as the majority of characters recruitment are trivial but can slightly change in unlock order, I'll cover them in the Misc section.

[**Step 1: Ending B Normal Mode**](#step-1-dummy-step--total-points-999)

First playthrough, you don't have access to the harder puzzle of Hard mode dungeons but you also don't get the most powerful equipment. I'd actually recommend a Normal mode run for anyone not familiar with the game rather than easy as the difficulty works a bit backward in the game. You don't have to level all your characters from level 1 as in hard mode so don't hesitate to test different lineups and see what clicks for you. This run should cover most of the progression and misc achievements. There are a couple of missables, but nothing that wouldn't be obvious if you take time to read the achievement description.

[**Step 2: Ending A Hard Mode**](#step-2-dummy-step-2--total-points-999)

Now that you are familiar with the game, this should be a breeze to go through for the most part. While everyone recruited start at level 1, you have access to enough tools to make it a blessing in disguise for customization. Hard mode dungeons are not necessarily harder from the enemies and boss encounters but more due to their puzzles and gimmick. I wont provide a full solution of those outside of a bit of advice here and there based on my experience. If not already the case, this run should also cover any story mode Misc achievements that you did not get through the Ending B playthrough. It's also here that you should prepare the most for postgame as this is the save you will need to use to access it if you want to unlock everything. 

***

[**Step 3: Postgame and Misc**](#step-3-dummy-step-3--total-points-999)

This last step will cover the postgame, unlocked by having a save in the last dungeon of the respective ending. Called the Seraphic Gate, you will have to run through it once for the usual map/treasure/boss completion achievements, find a couple of bonus fight and this is also where you will have to engage the biggest grind of the game to unlock 100% Voice clip completion. I'll also use this part to cover the non-story specific achievements that can (and in majority will) get unlocked long before you finish the game.

# 4) General Tips
### Exploration
Learn on how to use crystals. They are mandatory for most of the map completion achievements and for some of the chests acquisition. There are mainly five ways to use them.
 
* The first way is simply to create platform on walls or on the ground. This is used for straightforward platforming and scaling some wall. You can only have three at the same time, if you create a fourth the oldest will de-spawn
* Second way is to slash them to create pieces. Those pieces are independent from the crystal spawn count and can be used to reach the maximum height in a lot of rooms: create a large crystal where you want to climb, create and slash 3 small crystal to create pieces and move those pieces onto the big crystal. You can then jump once on the crystal, pick up the pieces again and this time stack them up (also work with chests if there are any lying around).
* Breaking a crystal while being near it will boost you to the side. This is only really needed in a handful of dungeon where low ceiling keep you from doing a straight jump.
* Breaking a crystal will also spawn a semi-invisible platform that you can jump on. This platform will slowly descend towards the ground before de-spawning, you should get the rhythm after a couple of tries. There are a few places where you cant simply scale up a wall due to terrain and will need to create a crystal on a ceiling to make a platform and continue.
* Finally you can throw crystal at enemies to freeze them for a bit. This can be used to bypass encounters but is at not point required for the set mastery.

As a misc, crystal are also used in a couple of puzzle. I'll touch upon it when covering the related section, but generally speaking crystals can reflect ice beam and broken pieces can be used as a weight.

Other than that, a good 3rd party map helps tremendously for chest and map completion. I couldn't find any online be it wiki or gamefaq, but if you manage to find a copy the Prima Official Strategy Guide is great !

### Levelling Up

As briefly touched upon before, Valkyrie Profile difficulty is a bit wonky once you know how the game work. As far as I'm aware there are no change in enemies stats, it only change which dungeon you have access to, how many xp you get and what level your fresh recruit start at (also lock you out of ending A if you chose Easy, but there are no reason to do an Easy run in the first place). In Hard mode, everyone start at level 1 and this can greatly get abused !

* A couple of equipment allow you to boost characters on each level up. The main two are the Bracelet of Zoe that boost DME (HP basically) by 300 per level up and the Emerald Necklace that boost CP (used for skills unlock) by 100 on the same condition.
* You can quickly level up new recruits through the "Party" menu. There you have the ability to attribute the "Event Exp" that you got while playing. I'd recommend not giving too much exp at once in order to not hit the CP cap (999) and also because being slightly under-levelled is not that bad if you have good equipment. For mage or archer, if you put them in the back row you could even skip this step entirely as they are mostly safe and should catch up quickly to the level of the dungeon you are running.
* An alternative use for the exp distribution would be to keep it for the units you don't like and plan to send to transfer.
* There should be not point at all in the story where you need to grind levels, but if you really want to there are very few places where you can farm for free. Any enemy killed will be gone for good until you quit the dungeon, which cost 2 time period. The few exception I found where the Arkdain Ruins that should re-spawn enemies when you goes through the entry gate (last zone before going back to the world map) and any chest that is trapped by an enemy spawn. You can kill the enemy, change room without picking the chest content and it will spawn a new one from it's trap. Again, this is not needed.

### Fighting Tips

* You can run away from most non-boss fight, even Zombie Dragon. Running away from a battle make the enemy despawn entirely, as if you had killed it.
* Having one or two mages in your lineup can trivialize most fights: by hitting Select and choosing the Magic tab, you can cast "All Units" spell. Those spells will hit every enemies with the same potency as if you had cast it regularly on a single enemy. The only downside is that you cant combo from it.
* The combo gauge increase your damages by the hit percentage so a useful strategy is to have characters with low damages but lots of hits go first and have your hard hitter attack last.
* Related to the previous tip, AOE spells when cast as a Big Magic also benefit from this and can be used to cheese a lot of early bosses. You wont get any unbreakable rod for a while, but you get a lot of breakable one that you could keep in reserve for a difficult boss
* Once you have the Guts and Auto-Item skills you become basically invulnerable. Guts make it so you have a high chance of surviving a killing blow with 1HP and Auto-Item can be configured to automatically use the revive items when guts fail. Outside of self-imposed challenge, there is no reason to use any other combo of main skills on any character.
* The Heal spell is a percentage-based AOE, meaning it will heal your team the same amount if cast by a lv 1 or by a lv 50.
* In the Ability tab you can switch around the attack order of your character. This can be useful to get better synergy. An example is switching around the attacks of Aelia so that she throws her spear in her first attack, making her timings easier to use.
* Slayer weapons are great for quickly getting rid of powerful enemies. The one you should use the most is the Dragon Slayer, with maybe the Beast Slayer being useful. They have a low chance of breaking but you shouldn't play around RNG, I'd recommend only using them on the relevant stationary enemy before going back to your regular loadout.
 

## Step 1: Ending B Normal Mode 

For this route, no seemingly random requirement to worry about: enjoy the dungeons, familiarize yourself with the game, send one or two Einherjar per chapter to please Freya and it should be a straight line to Jotunheim.

### Artolian Mountain Ruins
Baby's first dungeon and the tutorial, you should have no trouble here. One item you can find here is the Treasure Search accessories which will make a small blue light appears around Lenneth when she is in a room with unopened treasures. Quite useful if you're playing blind.

### Forest of Woe

Still the early game, if you use the Treasure Search accessories it can be a bit hard to see it trigger due to the snow effect. It's also where the game start the trend of hiding chests behind the foreground so don't forget to check those areas. I wont repeat it later because it will always work the same but this is also likely the first instance where you need to stack broken pieces/empty chests on top of a big crystal to be able to reach enough height to fully map the boss room.

### Solde Catacombs

Some light puzzle elements start to creep up. Your goal is to put all of the statue onto a seal. You can push/pull by pressing X near a statue, and you can slash the stone demons with your sword. You can trivialize the boss by equipping Valkyrie with a bow and bursting him down on the first round. There is a hidden room at the start of the dungeon accessible by jumping down the well.

### Dragoncastle Caverns
Pretty straightforward dungeon. The boss can be oneshot with a Dragon Slayer and you can get one for free for visiting Angrim's House.

### Nethov Swamp
Same as the previous dungeon, the Dragon Slayer can be used to rekt the boss.
