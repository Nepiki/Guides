:no_entry: **\*\* MAY CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS \*\*** :no_entry:

Note that the names of characters, places, etc. used in this guide are based off of the [Chaos Rush translation](https://www.romhacking.net/translations/4760/), which is closest to the official Square Enix translation for FFIII on the Nintendo DS. When possible, I will try to use both names with the Chaos Rush name first followed by the early translation in parentheses.

It will appear like this, as an example:
<br>Gysahl(Gisahl)

## Challenge Achievements

All of these achievements are **MISSABLE** because almost all of them are tied to completing a dungeon, including a one-time boss battle, under specific conditions! Prior to attempting, I _highly recommend_ saving prior to attempting. If the achievement doesn't pop upon completing the boss fight, reset and try again. You should be safe if you set up the party's Jobs prior to entering the dungeon associated with the challenge.
<br>Make sure you have at least **ONE MAGIC KEY** from Gysahl(Gisahl) prior to leaving the Floating Continent for the first time (or get **four** to be safe)!

The achievement will be completed if you defeat the Djinn(Jinn) without changing jobs. In my playthrough, I used other jobs so I made sure to change my party back to Onion Knights before entering the cave. <br>Overall, the challenge isn't too difficult to complete with Onion Knights if you have been persistent in fighting and gaining levels. The Onion Knight job skill level should be inconsequential to success but it can't hurt to grind some job levels if you are concerned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Once you find the right one, if you are quick, you can keep casting the spell before Hein shifts the barrier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

The Cave of Shadows(Darkness) is 11(!) floors of pain, due to the dividing enemies that will split with any physical attack. Since Magic Knights are prohibited, using magic/summons are a good alternative. If you don't have characters with magic or summons built up, I suggest grinding to build up the job skills and levels for your characters. Since the Evoker(Conjurer) is unpredictable, I recommend sticking with a White Mage for healing/Aero/Confuse and a Black Mage for dealing damage. The ideal location for grinding is in the first floor of the Cave of Bahamut as the monsters there are low risk with a lot of experience points. Raising levels will increase your cast count for each spell level. It is okay to keep physical combatants as well for taking damage and providing killing blows that won't cause splitting. I used the Knight and Black Belt(Karateka), but you can change it up based on your primary role for these characters. <br>Once you feel ready, begin your descent into the Cave of Shadows! I recommend taking this over multiple dives, gathering items from a floor, climbing back out, recovering in the Invincible, and saving your game once you clear a floor. This will allow you to determine your capabilities to go further and make subsequent dives in previously cleared floors quicker. <br>A key strategy that I used was casting the White Mage's Confuse spell. Confused enemies will not split when hit with a physical attack! Use this to your advantage on encounters with three or four monsters to the greatest effect. Let enemies hit each other or themselves and follow up with a strong physical to take them out without dividing. Concentrate black magic spells on single targets to do more damage to get them within one-shot physical attack range. As you get further, you will get stronger and then be able to complete the dive, fight the boss, and get the achievement. <br>One other possibility is to simply ignore the items until after completing the challenge, and then dive back in with a party of Magic Knights to clear out the treasure. My luck with running from encounters in this dungeon (and pretty much the entirety of the late game) was non-existent so a Thief could aid with this approach as well. |

When I learned that Reflect was actually capable of sending Mega Flare back at Bahamut in this game, I was sad to see that this challenge prevents that. So, I used Bahamut's cave to prepare for this fight, raising my levels and job skill levels up to be able to take the hits from Mega Flare. Sometimes, you'll get lucky and Bahamut won't use the skill that much. Other times, it'll use it every single round! So, by building my levels to around 50-ish, I was able to survive just fine and take him out quickly. I used dual-wielding Knight and Magic Knight (I had been building my Knight to get the [Top of the Class](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43078) achievement) with a White Mage to heal and Black Mage to cast Bio. If your team is getting wiped by Mega Flare, you will just need to get more levels. <br>I didn't try this, but I believe using the Curtain(Barrier) item will also prevent getting this achievement, since the item has the same effect as Reflect(Wall).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

RA User Gamechamp defined several locations in their [post](https://retroachievements.org/viewtopic.php?t=2232&c=48153#48153) regarding the locations that are inaccessible after completing them: Nepto Temple(Shrine of Nepto), the Dwarves' Subterranean(Underground) Lake, Castle Hein(Hyne), Doga(Dorga)'s Cave, and Lake Dohr(Dol). I played with the maps from [RPGClassics](http://shrines.rpgclassics.com/nes/ff3/maps.shtml) to ensure that I found every chest in these dungeons in particular. I noted that there are some discussions on the [achievement page](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/43079) concerning various maps that don't show all of the hidden items, especially in some towns. The RPGClassics maps also don't have every location mapped, such as the Gurgan Gulch(Valley) which has a hidden path to three chests. Another strategy brought up is the use of the RALibretro achievement editor to see if an area has had all of its chests opened, but I won't go into details on that here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
