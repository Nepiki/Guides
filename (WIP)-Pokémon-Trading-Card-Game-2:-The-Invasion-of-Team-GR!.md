# Overview

* Achievement set difficulty: 2/10
* Estimated time to complete: ~30-40 hours
* Number of play throughs necessary: 1
* Missable achievements: 10/76

***

# Introduction

It was released on March 28, 2001, exclusively in Japan, and is the last Pokémon game released for the Game Boy Color.

The game adds many new features not present in the original, such as new cards, the ability to play as a female character, a much more expansive in-game world, and contains nearly all of the cards from Base Set, Jungle, Fossil, and Team Rocket. It also features a more developed story in that, rather than just collecting cards and defeating the Grand Masters, the player must defeat a new villainous team, Team Great Rocket.

***

# Road Map

Some of the achievements are progression based and can't be missed, or done out of order, but many of them can be done at any time. The missable achievements are mostly events that open up and close at specific points during progression and battles with your Rival that you can only attempt once. They become available when certain conditions are met and you cannot avoid them when they do.

This guide will have the missable achievements listed first in the order they appear in the game for convenience. This will put the missable achievements out of order from the achievement list on RA. The rest will be in the RA order otherwise.

_Receive the Horsea Coin for winning the GR Island Challenge Cup 10 times!_

These cannot be obtained until after defeating Villicilli. Winning the cup 10 times in a row, without losing, isn't necessary. You only need to win 10 times total.

To get either Challenge Cup to begin, save your game in any location that aren't the Challenge Halls, Mason's Lab, or Ishihara's house/villa. After you save, reset the game, and check the Challenge Halls. Like Imakuni?, the Challenge Cups have a chance to begin every time the save file is loaded. It isn't guaranteed each time, though. Just keep resetting and loading until it starts. It's possible to have both cups begin on the same file load.

_Receive the Dugtrio Coin for winning 50 consecutive matches on Dr. Mason's Challenge Machine!_

![217204](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/assets/97459553/271c85aa-ab7d-44df-ab58-59e7fff10ce7) Gengar Coin

_Receive the Gengar Coin for winning 50 consecutive matches on the GR Challenge Machine!_

After defeating Villicilli, the Challenge Machine becomes available in Dr. Mason's lab, and the GR Challenge Machine on GR Island's Challenge Hall main stage when there isn't an active GR Challenge Cup. The machine tracks your "consecutive wins" after each trainer set of five you defeat. Saving after each set is recommended and resetting from a save doesn't interrupt your winning streak.

You cannot stop a set until all five trainers are defeated. If you do, your streak will be broken. The game will warn you before letting you quit a set. A lady will approach you and hand you the coin upon the 50th consecutive match win.

The opponents are random and thus widely vary in typing. You will fight three club trainers, a club boss, and a "main boss". Main bosses are: Ronald, Villicilli, Aaron (Mason's Lab tutorial trainer), and both of Villicilli's executives.

The easiest way to defeat each set with a single deck is to build a Legendary Zapdos deck. It consists of only a single Legendary Zapdos Lv.64 and many stalling/healing items. Zapdos has no weakness and its only attack bypasses Pokémon type resistance. Not having any other Pokémon in your deck ensures it will only hit your opponent's Pokémon since it can't target Zapdos.

The best strategy is to make sure you can get all energy on Zapdos as quickly as you can, use healing items as necessary, and try to remove energy from your opponent's active Pokémon as often as possible to keep it from attacking or retreating. Many trainers will open with a Kangaskhan and only attach one energy to it to use Fetch.

It's meant to be a stalling opener so they can draw the cards they need to fuel their deck. They'll start attaching energy to it for attacking after they've powered up their necessary Pokémon first. Since Zapdos' attack can target bench Pokémon as well, this AI programming gives you more of an advantage than it does them.

Here's the deck build I had the most win consistency with.

_Open all chests in the GR Fighting Fortress!_

There are six chests in the fortress that need to be opened. One of them only spawns after defeating Grace. There are many pitfalls that will drop you into the basement and back to the beginning.

_Defeat the Grand Masters and claim the legendary Pokémon cards!_

After defeating Clair, and "rescuing" Rod, you have to go back to the TCG Island Pokémon Dome to fight the Grand Masters from the first game. Defeat them all and you'll be granted the cards.

If you're having trouble, you can use the Legendary Zapdos deck mentioned earlier in this guide in the Dugtrio & Gengar Coin achievements. You are able to obtain the Legendary Zapdops Lv.68 card before winning it from the Grand Masters by putting a Raichu Lv.40, Dark Raichu, and Zapdos Lv.64 into the Black Box at the Game Center and leaving the last two slots empty. This will yield a Legendary Zapdos card each time.

Their decks are both mostly Water/Psychic. They can be challenged in a random club lobby, on their respective islands, once each time you load a save file. You must talk to characters in the Water Club lobby to learn about Imakuni? Black. Afterwards, both Imakuni? will begin to appear on their respective islands. If you wish to farm them for packs, save, reset, and check the lobbies until you hear their music.

_Get 10 Heads in the Coin Flip Combo Game, and claim Mew Lv8!_

It's uncertain if results are predetermined before each flip, like they are in duels, or if there's an actual strategy for it. Just keep playing until you win. It can take a few minutes or a few hours. At least you'll end up with enough coins to purchase all the things you need from the Game Center prize counter by the time you're done. Good luck!

**Note**: if anyone wants to look at the game's memory for the mini-game, to give a more definitive answer on if it's predetermined or not, let me know what you find and I'll update this information.

_Purchase a Mew Lv15 from the Game Center!_

Both cards cost 2,000 chips each at the Prize Counter. Playing the 10-Head Flip game is the fastest way to earn a lot of chips quickly.

_End any match in a draw!_

Easiest way is to challenge Brandon in the Lightning Club using the Deck List below. His deck is the easiest to set up against due to 
damage resistance. Nicholas and Isaac use much more Colorless Pokémon and Jennifer uses Water.

Strategy Tips: 

* Play Diglett as the active Pokémon since it has resistance to Electric and Geodude doesn't.
* Build up to a Golem with enough energy for Self Destruct. Don't waste turns/energy building up Diglett.
* Use Scoop Up to return Diglett to your hand, leaving only Golem left in play.
* Work your opponent down to their last Pokémon using Avalanche and then Self Destruct.

Computer Search, Pokémon Trader, Pokémon Breeder, and Pokéball make it much easier to get what you need quickly.

It must be done while you have two or more prizes left to win. If the final Pokémon you knock out would allow you to draw your final prize, the match is counted as a win instead of a draw. If your opponent benches more than two Pokémon while you set up, reset and try again.

_Complete Step 3 of Aaron's training regimen!_

May as well be done before leaving Mason's Lab. You have to use preconstructed decks he hands you for each match, anyway. You can't use your own custom decks.

_At the Game Center, defeat Pawn, Knight, Bishop, Rook, and Queen consecutively without losing or loading a save!_

The easiest strategy is to use the Legendary Zapdos deck build mentioned at the beginning of this guide. If you wish to use your own builds, their deck lists are linked below.

_Defeat Axel by obtaining all prizes without ever KO-ing his active Pokémon! [No In-Battle Save]_

Recommended Deck List

Strategy Tips:

* It's common for Axel to open up with Scyther. He'll attach single energy, Swords Dance each turn, and then prioritize his bench. This gives you time to set up and do some damage.

* His AI is programmed to fill his bench and set up Wigglytuff to use "Do the Wave" as soon as possible. Scyther resists Fighting so it must be the best option to stall with until then. It's not checking to see if your Pokémon can attack the bench directly.

* Try to remove energy from Jiggly/Wiggly when you're able. Use Gust of Wind to keep them benched if necessary. He usually won't bring them back out until Wigglytuff is ready or he has no other options. 

* Use Stretch Kick, attack his bench, and focus on knocking out Jigglypuff and/or Wigglytuff first. Then, go for whatever you want until you win.

* Computer Search and Itemfinder can be used to find energy removal cards, or return them to your hand, so you can keep him from setting up. There's plenty of extra cards you can toss away to use them.

* Recycle Energy is for feeding Super Energy Removal and Super Potions since it comes right back to your hand. It doesn't return to you if you discard it to use Computer Search or Itemfinder.

_Defeat Magician by obtaining all prizes without ever dealing more than 20 damage in a single attack to a Pokemon! [No In-Battle Save]_

Recommended Deck Build

Strategy Tips:

* Try to get Muk onto your bench ASAP and keep it there. It's only used for its Pokémon Power "Toxic Gas" to counter all of the Pokémon Powers he relies on.

* His AI is programmed to get Alakazam and Tentacool onto the bench as quickly as possible. Alakazam can use Damage Swap to move damage around as he sees fit and Tentacool can use Cowardice to return it to his had at any time. The combo is to move 20 damage to Tentacool, return it to his hand, put it back onto the bench, wash, rinse, and repeat until all damage has been removed from all of his Pokémon.

* He also relies on Mr. Mime's "Neutral Damage" to remove weakness/resistance. This lets him damage Colorless Pokémon and keep Psychic from doing much more damage than he can remove with the strategy above.

* Since the achievement requires to do no less than 20 damage per attack, it's extremely difficult to kill either one, but Toxic Gas renders his deck useless. It blocks all other Pokémon Powers as long as Muk is alive and well on the bench.

* Dark Persian's "Poison Claws" can get in some extra damage, since poison is done in between turns, and doesn't count towards the 20 damage cap for the achievement. Both are resistant to Psychic, making it easier to keep them alive for the long haul, since Muk keeps Mr. Mime from ruining the fun. None of his Pokémon can deal enough damage to get past their resistance without that Mr. Mime.

* Gambler's are used to shuffle your hand back into your deck, not draw cards. It's a battle of attrition and his primary goal isn't to knock out your team; it's to out last you. When your hand gets to 20+, use Gambler to shuffle it back in so you don't overdraw too soon. He uses four Nightly Garbage Run's to keep from overdrawing before you and the above strategy to stay alive long enough to do so.

**Note: If anyone has a more efficient deck build, let me know, and I'll update this information.**
