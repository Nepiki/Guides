# 2) Introduction

One of my all time favorite Atari 2600 games. While inferior in graphics to it's arcade counterpart, this version holds it's own and is allot of fun to play. Phoenix originally came packaged with Atari Force #4, it is very goofy but fun and very much from it's era of comics and I highly suggest giving it a read if you ever have the chance as I think it adds to the whole experience.

# 3) Walkthrough

## **Player Movement**
Directional Controls in Phoenix are straight forward. Left is left, Right is right. However, if you press down it will activate a force field that will absorb all enemy missiles while it is active. There is a cooldown of around 4 seconds before the player can use it again. I feel that it also bears mentioning that the player can angle their shots if they fire while moving, this can be used to great effect in Waves 3 and 4.

## **Scoring**
Something that might not be noticed immediately are point values based on enemy location. For small Phoenix, in Waves 1 and 2, wait for the enemy to swoop down and when it is nearly at it's lowest level destroy it to gain 80 points over the standard 20. For the large Phoenix in Waves 3 and 4 the lower the Phoenix is to the bottom of the screen, the more points it is worth. At it's highest level on screen a large Phoenix will net you 100 points, the lower it is when you destroy it, the higher the point value. Up to a max of 500 points. Hitting a large Phoenix in the wing will get you 20 points per wing. The mothership's point value is based on it's height at time of destruction. Ranging in value from  1,000 to 4,000 points in Phase 1. The max point value increasing by 1,000 points every time you complete a Phase, up to a max of 9,000 points.

# 4) Achievement Guide | **Total Points: 343**

As Phoenix is an arcade style game there aren't any achievements that can be missed, as the game can just be reset and a complete Phase of 5 Waves can be completed in under a minute. There is a mix of progression, challenge, time trial and scoring achievements spanning all 5 Waves and at least 10 consecutive Phases of play.

_Use your force field for the first time, and get stuck in place._

Simply press down to activate your force field. This can be done on any Wave.

_Destroy a blue Phoenix with your Force Field._

If you are on Phase 1 you will have to eliminate all of the Phoenix except for the top two (If you don't care about losing a life you can destroy them in any order, if they don't come down die and reset their positions). If you are in Phase 2 or higher the large Phoenix will swoop low enough if you destroy all but three of them. Maneuver underneath as they come down and activate your force field just before impact.

_Destroy a red Phoenix with your Force Field._

This is the same as _Like a Phoenix to the Force Field_ the large red Phoenix AI is slightly more aggressive though, so don't let their swooping patterns throw you off.

While I don't post allot, it is usually only because someone has either already asked or because someone posts something that answers my question before I ask it, I appreciate all of the invaluable info that you all have provided.
