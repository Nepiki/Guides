<details><summary>Spoilers</summary>Spike can be found out in the backyard in Pickle's Home. Various toys and items are scattered about. There are three different items that Spike will retrieve if thrown: the yellow ball, the stick, and the bone.</details>

<details><summary>Spoilers</summary>

There are five holes that a hole-in-one can be gotten on: Hole 1, Hole 2, Hole 3, Hole 6, and Hole 9.
* Hole 1: `Aim straight and shoot with about 75% power for a hole-in-one.`
* Hole 2: `Aim to the left of the hole using the letter 'c' closest to the flag as a guide (you'll want to aim at the left side of the 'c') and use 100% power to get a hole-in-one.`
* Hole 3: `Aim straight, press triangle as soon as the door begins to close from open position, and shoot at 100% power to get a hole-in-one.`
* Hole 6: `When aiming, go two brick blocks over to the left of the flag. To the right of that block is a purple Saturn on the wall. Aim at the left edge of the Saturn and shoot at 100% power for a hole-in-one.`
* Hole 9: `When aiming, check for the first chocolate ice cream bar to the left of the hole. Aim just to the right of its popsicle stick and shoot at 100% for a hole-in-one. This can be done in other ways, but this tends to be the easiest method.`</details>

<details><summary>Spoilers</summary>In the level Ice Cream Mountain on Hole 8 is a pyramid. If you go around the side you'll find a doorway you can enter. Keep left (directions coming soon) and you'll eventually hear a mechanical sound. In a small lit room is a mummy version of Mr. Friend. He will follow you. Try to lead him back out of the pyramid and he'll meet his demise.</details>

<details><summary>Spoilers</summary> When aiming, check for the first chocolate ice cream bar to the left of the hole. Aim just to the right of its popsicle stick and shoot at 100% for a hole-in-one. This can be done in other ways, but this tends to be the easiest method. (video tutorial coming soon)</details>

![Image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/136866.png) **[Stranger Danger](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/124410)** _~Defeat Mr. Friend without taking damage._

<details><summary>Spoilers</summary>Honestly this is the most difficult achievement out of the set. Originally I wasn't going to implement it but there is a technique.

The first stage of the fight is easy, just do as the game suggests and knock out the first Mr. Friend with cans lying around (avoid using balls - they bounce back and can damage you).

The second stage throws you against 3 of the freaky clowns. Sometimes one or two of the Mr. Friends is freakishly fast. Now for the fun part. You'll notice they're somewhat invincible to having stuff tossed at them. The game recommends you kick them but I don't recommend that as sometimes the kick is delayed and they'll get a hit on you.

First you'll want to take out one of the Friends with cans; focus on one of the fast ones if able. Once the first one is down, cans are no longer useful. I found that jumping at them with well-timed jumps will allow you to bowl them over without getting hurt. Take out your second one with this tactic. The last one is trickier. By this point I had trouble getting a good timed jump. It seemed like no matter what I kept getting hit. There is a box out in the open near the stairs that you can climb onto. Once you're on top of that box, Mr. Friend can't climb up since you're in the way and he can't hurt you because you're too high. Simply jump down onto his head and he'll get knocked back. Repeat until you explode the last clown to bits. (You may be able to use the box technique from the get-go.)

There are other ways to accomplish this. Some people manage to use the kick. This is just what worked for me in the end.</details>

<details><summary>Spoilers</summary>The three easy levels required for this achievement are Ice Cream Mountain, Chuckie's Glasses, and Mysterious Mr. Friend.
