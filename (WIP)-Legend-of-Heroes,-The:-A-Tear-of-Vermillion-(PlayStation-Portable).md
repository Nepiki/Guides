[**Step 1: Chapter 1**](#step-1-chapter-1--total-points-64)

This step covers all the achievements that can be obtained during chapter 1 in chronological order of when you can first get them. There are a total of four missable achievements, though chapter two still allows you to revisit most of the places from chapter one, meaning that if you missed one, you can still get it then. There are only two real missable achievements to watch out for that can only be obtained during chapter 1:

- [Gingko Round Dance](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/197982) - Has to be done before reaching the capital for the first time.
- [Rookie Treasure Hunter](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/197989) - While it can technically be finished in chapter 2, it is recommended to do this before the end of chapter 1 due to the first area listed in the achievement becoming inaccessible after chapter 1 ends. The point of no return is upon finishing the Prayer Woods.

Other important events that need to be done in Chapter 1 and will take an important role in later chapters:
- You will be seeing the writer Karamus and his manager Jyamane frequently throughout the game. You will first meet them in the Phildin. When your first Adventurer's Guild task starts, talk to Karamus in the north side of the bottom screen of the capital, and Jyamane in the inn south of him. They both must leave for this interaction to be finished.
- This chapter has a total of **two** Swordmaster books to collect. Both of them have missable achievements so you know when you have them.

**Chapter 1's point of no return is after the Prayer Woods.**

***

[**Step 2: Chapter 2**](#step-2-chapter-2--total-points-138)

This step covers all the achievements that can be obtained during chapter 2 in chronological order of when you can first get them. Unlike chapter 1 however, your breathing room for missable achievements is decreased by quite a lot. Whenever you leave a town or a route, be under the assumption that you cannot go back to them whatsoever. Therefore, every missable achievement is also truly missable. Check them out in the following order:

Other important events that need to be done in Chapter 2 and will take an important role in later chapters:

- You will first be meeting Karamus and Jyamane on the top floor of the inn in Borum. Talk to them both.
- Karamus will appear after some events in New Borum (before heading to the monastery for the first time), while Jyamane will appear later after the fog has been cleared.
- Karamus will be at Guia right from the start, while Jyamane will appear after having gone to the power plant.
- Karamus will be at Balloa right from the start, while Jyamane is only shortly available before going to the Silver Mine.
- Jyamane will be at Theta during your second visit.
- Karamus will be at Dorx
- This chapter has a total of **tree** Swordmaster books to collect. Both of them have missable achievements so you know when you have them.

***

[**Step 3: Dummy Step 3**](#step-3-dummy-step-3--total-points-999)

Dummy step. Remove if unnecessary.

# 4) General Gameplay Tips

- Due to how the PlayStation Portable works, it is very easy to create multiple saves. Use that to your advantage!
- Use Mile's Steal ability frequently to save yourself some cash with getting items, as well as good gear. His stealing probability is pretty high, so you're almost always guaranteed to get something.
- You are at all times followed by a rabbit companion. It showing loving- or angry emotions can both be beneficial in battle, while it trying to get your attention means it found an item.
