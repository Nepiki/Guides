# 1) Introduction

Welcome to the RA guide for **Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge** for the PS2!

The game released in 2005 for PS2 and XBOX, developed by CAPCOM, and it proposes itself as a sequel to the 1993 movie, **Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas**. The game has some similiarity to **Devil May Cry**, like the combo ranking, level progression and secrets, although it is much easier to play.

The game takes place some time after the events of the film. Jack yet again gets bored of Halloween. He goes to Doctor Finkelstein for advice in how to improve the next halloween. The Doctor gives him his newest creation: SOUL ROBBER! A green slime that acts like a whip. Jack than decides to leave Halloween Town in search for new ideas, and leaves the Doctor in charge of the town. But Lock, Shock, and Barrel took this opportunity to revive Oogie Boogie, which then began his plot to take revenge, taking over not only Halloween Town, but all the other holidays too, to become the "Seven Holidays King". Sally manages to send a letter to Jack about what was going on, so he huries back to his town to fix the mess.

```
⚠️ The only supported version of the game is the european version. When playing this version,
the game will ask you at what refresh rate, or video mode, to play the game. Only select 60Hz to 
be able to earn achievements, as 50Hz is not supported.
```

# 2) Overview

[**Progression**](#progression)

These can't be missed and will be naturally unlocked by just playing through the game. While doing these, you should also go for the extras achievements, as this is the best opportunity to get them out of the way and to also get ready for the rest of the set.

Most importantly, you can decide to start on Nightmare Mode, the highest difficulty in the game. Despite the increse in difficulty, it is still manageable enough to get through the game. And besides, all of the challenge achievements will require this difficulty anyway.

***

[**Rank S**](#rank-s)

Most of the ranking achievements are about the A rank, as that's the requirement to be rewarded a figurine. Getting A rank is not that difficult, but getting S rank does require you to go out of your way to reach their requirements. It also needs to be done on Nightmare Mode because of The Seven Holidays King.

More about how to ranking system will be explained in The Seven Holidays King, as well as each of the A rank achievement will have tips and video guides about getting the S rank. Sadly I can't know exactly the requirements for A rank, but since we are interested more in getting the S ranks, it won't matter as much.

Your 2nd playthrough of the game 

# 3) Tips

* **Combos** - Soul Spin (↻ Left Stick, ▢) is your best friend to get combos. Another suggestion to do more combos is to taunt an enemy (Directional Button) to make them more durable, especially if they're already damaged to make them replenish some health.
* **Taunt** - Taunt (Directional Button) is primarily used to get exclamation points, and it can be used repeatedly on the same enemy, even if they are already in Oogie Mode, to rack up exclamation points. You need to wait for them to finish their "startled" animation first before you're able to taunt them again.
* **Blue Souls** - Not only will they increase damage, but when using Soul Cycle (△ Charged), use a blue soul when you see the Soul Rubber becoming almost red to extended the move duration. This is very powerful when in enclosed areas full of normal size enemies.
* **Pumpkin King Costume** - While it is a powerful costume, with Fire Bomb (△) doing very high damage, the costume is often used for puzzles and exploration, and it is better to conserve the Red Souls to avoid annoyance.
* **Santa Jack Costume** - The presents can be used against the enemies hidden in things to discover them and not be immediately retaliated. The presents can have different usages: Re-Possession takes them out of their Oogie Mode (they usualy always are when hidden), Scared Stiff will stun them in place (especially effective against Halloween and King Ghosts).
* **Dodge Extension** - The Dodge (◯) has a tiny bit of invincibility that normally requires to be timed with precision to use. If right after dodging (O), you quickly change into any costume you have (L1 / R1), the invicibility from the dodgee is followed by the invincibility from changing costume extending it. Normally, changing costume has you standing in place, but this gets cancelled out when done right after a dodge, with good timing.

```
⚠️ Earning all the figurines in the game will reward you with infinite Red Souls for your Pumpkin King Costume.
Everything is doable without this, but if you want an advantage, you could wait until getting this reward before
doing anything that requires the Pumpkin King Costume. The set doesn't block this eitherway.
```

## Progression

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248483.png">

```
This is Oogie-Town [5]
Defeat Oogie Boogie's Shadow and recover the Halloween Door
```
`PROGRESSION`

* He will every so often throw dices at you. These can easily be dodged (O) with the right timing, or you can dodge them just by keeping walking left or fight.
* The Halloween Ghosts won't give that much trouble, but can be rather annoying. Soul Spin will let you damage them while also damaging Oogie Boogie's Shadow, and also collect the notes they'll drop. They can also potentially drop a Blue Soul, letting you deal more damage to Oogie Boogie's Shadow.
* When Oogie Boogie's Shadow starts to sing the WOW part of the song, the Halloween Ghosts will pick up bigger dices to drop them at you. Start to dodge them right when Oogie Boogie's Shadow sings WOW for the third time.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248514.png">

```
Damcel in Distress [5]
Defeat the Mega Spider and recover the Valentine's Day Door
```
`PROGRESSION`

* It has a weak spot on his back that when hit, he becomes many tiny versions of itself. Soul Spin is a very effective move here, as it'll attract the tiny spiders to you making it easier to hit them.
* Keep some distance from the spider, as he has 3 different attacks that he can do at random. Preferably don't stand in front of him, since he'll always turn himself to face into your direction before attacking.
* The web projectiles does not damage you, but will block you in place, even when the web is on the ground. He'll also start to spit 2 more projectiles when reaches half his health bar.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248515.png">

```
Cerebrum Cleansed [5]
Defeat Dr. Finkelstein and recover the St Patrick's Day Door
```
`PROGRESSION`

* The only way to damage him is to throw the pieces of brain on a tray to your left of where you star at him while his head is open.
* One way to open his head is to grab him from behind with △ until it opens. Then throw the pieces of brain right in front of him.
* You can also collect notes by destroying his machinery or even trying to open his head to open it.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248516.png">

```
Thanks for Giving the Door [5]
Defeat Barrel and his Army of Skeletons and recover the Thanksgiving Door
```
`PROGRESSION`

* He'll run around the arena and sometimes summons enemies. Follow him and hit him when possible.
* He can be taunted, which stuns him and lets you charge your Soul Robber for a high damage Soul Spin. You can do this repeatedly in quick succession.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248517.png">

```
Trick or Treat! [5]
Defeat Lock, Shock and Barrel and recover the Independence Day Door
```
`PROGRESSION`

* If you hit them with the bear traps, they'll be stuck in place for some free hits. Be aware that they can still attack while immobilized.
* When the bathtub is destroyed, all three will get off of it and attack you. Of the 3, Shock is the most dangerous one, as her attack is kind of hard to avoid. They'll run away when you'r going after them, so try your best to go after Shock.
* Fire Blast from the Pumpkin King Costume is very useful here. It'll blast them off in the air while also dealing high damage. If you can, try to hit all of them in one blast.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248518.png">

```
Boogeyman's Wager [10]
Defeat Oogie Boogie and recover the Easter Door
```
`PROGRESSION`

* Stay close to the central platform and destroy the cards immediately as they appear. Back off the platform a bit after destroying at least 1 card.
* The gunners if destoyed will shoot at Oogie for a bit of damage. However, it's difficult to destroy them, as they become vulnerable the moment they start shooting. You can either go to a safe angle or Fire Blast at the right moment, or just go to the opposite site of the arena where it's safe.
* After the gunners, the cards will reapper, except for the ones destroyed before. It's the same thing as before, but after a while exploding dices will appear from the ground. You need to throw them away with △ immediately.
* Then the dices will appear again, but they won't explode immediately. At this moment, Oogie will sing the WOW part of the song, and he'll have his mouth wide open. Throw the dices at him when his mouth is open and stay right on the empty spot where the dice was to avoid the explosions. After the third WOW, Oogie will explode, taking damage and stunned for a bit, making him vulnerable to some damage. Everything will repeat from the start then.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248519.png">

```
A Dance of Fire and Ice [10]
Defeat the Fire King and Ice King Skeletons and recover the Christmas Door
```
`PROGRESSION`

* Both the Fire King Skeleton and the Ice King Skeleton are basically bigger King Skeletons, so just like them the best way to defeat them is to attack them from behind.
* Ice King Skeleton will go down very easily via Fire Blast from the Pumpkin King Costume. Don't use the costume against the Fire King Skeleton or it'll heal from it.
* When either of them turns black, use Santa Jack's Re-Possession present to turn them back to normal.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248520.png">

```
Father Christmas' Sorrow [10]
Defeat the Oogie Train to save Sandy
```
`PROGRESSION`

* Make it a priority to hit the lever closest to where the train is coming from. A red light will signal you which one it is.
* The area is full of hidden enemies that make traversing anywhere a challenge. Either attack them at a safe distance or use a Re-Possession present on them.
* The Train will damage you if you stand in front of it. Keep that in mind while attacking it.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248521.png">

```
You're King Of Nothing! [25]
Defeat Mega Oogie and save all of the Holidays!
```
`COMPLETION`

* You can hit his feet to make him fall (get away from where he falls!). This makes his head reachable with your attacks, but while staying on ground level it makes it easier to get hit by his attacks.
* The other option is to stand in the upper part of the arena, and make him come closer to the gas leaks. When close, light them up with any attack from the Pumpkin King Costume for a good amount of damage. The gas leaks wiull reappear after a while.
* If you hear him growling, he's about to throw stuff at you. You can avoid it by dodging at a good distance or going up and down the arena will make him stop the attack.
* If you're in the upper arena, he'll try to smack you when close. This can be dodged, but it requires a really close timing. You could instead drop down the arena or keep a distance from him as fast as possible.
* After the fight, you'll transition into a dance sequence. This one is the hardest in the game, and anytime you miss a button you'll lose health. The last parts in the dance are hard to do correctly, so they'll most likely cost you some health. As long as you have enough health to go through this, you'll be fine.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248701.png">

```
Jack Must Die! [25]
Beat the game on Nightmare Mode
```
`COMPLETION`

You'll earn this after beating chapter 24 on Nightmare Mode.

That wasn't so bad... right?

## Rank S

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248562.png">

```
Jack's Return [5]
Get an "A" or higher in all Ranks in Chapter 1
```
`PROGRESSION`

* Time: 8:00
* Combo: 120
* Damage: 4
* !-Count: 30

If you don't waste time anywhere else, like saving to game or going into the Hidden Place, and go straight to Oogie Boogie's Shadow, you won't have any problems with time.

Bundle the Skeletons together and Soul Spin them until less than half health. Then Taunt to get them into Oogie Mode (you may need to hit them right after to keep the combo going) and Soul Spin again for even more combos. You should also defeat one Skeleton earlier, so that when the transformed ones are defeated you can hit this one while you wait for the others to spawn.

You can constantly taunt the Skeletons to get many exclamation marks. Otherwise, just do a Full Combo dance against Oogie Boogie's Shadow to get the exact amount needed.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248563.png">

```
The Witching Hour [5]
Get an "A" or higher in all Ranks in Chapter 2
```
`PROGRESSION`

* Time: 5:00
* Combo: 100
* Damage: 4
* !-Count: 5

This is a short chapter, as long as you ignore any fights in town. The only fights you're needed to do is the one in the sewer and the one in front of the gate after speaking with the Clown in the sewer. The number of enemies in front of the gate can be at random, but not a problem at all.

Use the enemies in the sewer for combos. You could use Soul Cycle here, but it won't let you reach the 100 combo required, so just Soul Spin and taunt them. You can always use the enemies in front of the gate if unable to do it there.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248564.png">

```
The Hanging Tree [5]
Get an "A" or higher in all Ranks in Chapter 3
```
`PROGRESSION`

* Time: 11:00
* Combo: 280
* Damage: 4
* !-Count: 30

Know beforehand the location of the Hanging Men to make time a non-issue. Though you do have some leniency with time here, and Zero helps you by locating them. Remember to speak to the Hanging Tree when you find all 5 of them.

Soul Cycle during the Lock fight is the best, and probably the only place where you can achieve the combo amount needed, and to also get the exclamation marks needed. Whenever Soul Robber starts to become red, use a Blue Soul to replenish its duration. Do this until you use up all your Blue Souls or few enemies remain, then just Soul Spin and Taunt the remaining ones.

Soul Cycle during Lock's Fight also makes not taking damage much easier. Only other risky place is when going through the statues that spit flames in the second section of the graveyard. Take your time when passing through them (dodging won't work here), and make sure no enemies are following you while going through here.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248565.png">

```
Grave Danger [5]
Get an "A" or higher in all Ranks in Chapter 4
```
`PROGRESSION`

* Time: 7:00
* Combo: 100
* Damage: 8
* !-Count: 25

Just like with the Hanging Men, know beforehand the location of all the tombstones. They can be located with purple souls coming out of them. Also remember to speak to the Hanging Tree when done.

You shouldn't have any problems going through any fights and get to the combos and exclamation marks required. One good fight to go to is the one in front of the entrance to the next section of the graveyard.

The Skeleton Troll is a good target for combos, especially when it drops its mace for some easy Soul Spins. If you Taunt it, rather then immediately attacking it'll stand in place to make a loud noise. You can still hit it while it does so, but you can taunt it again the moment he's finished with the loud noise to keep it in place there. This is good to keep also keep a low damage count, as it is actually a bit dangerous.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248699.png">

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248565.png">

```
Grave Danger [5]
Get an "A" or higher in all Ranks in Chapter 4
```
`PROGRESSION`

* Time: 9:00
* Combo: 59
* Damage: 8
* !-Count: 59

The Lock boss fight will most likely waste you some time here. If you get close to him fast enough, you can stun him by Taunting, then hit him with a Soul Spin and then repeat. Otherwise, catch him while in the air and engage the Skeletons only if they're too close. Lock will jump up in the air to attack you from above. If a shadow appears underneath you, dodge out of the shadow.

All the combo and exclamation marks can be done during the boss fight against the Super Spider. Be patient and dodge its attacks when it is a good opportunity to attack its weak spot. After hitting its weakspot, charge Soul Robber with Square, then when the tiny spiders appear, perform a Soul Spin to hit most of them. It should go down with no problems if you're patient enough to wait its attacks.

<img align="left" width="72" height="72" src="https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/248703.png">

```
The Seven Holidays King [50]
Beat the game with an overall "S" ranking on all levels and successfully complete both
secret chapters on Nightmare Mode
```
`COMPLETION`

When you beat a level, the game will rank you based on different categories, and then give you a total rank of the level. The categories are:
* Time: how much time you spent to beat the level;
* Combo: Highest combo number without breaking it;
* Damage: Amount of hits taken;
* Exclamation points: These points can be earned by taunting, using Santa Jack's presents, and during dances by pressing the correct buttons.

The game tracks the highest rank you earn in each of the categories, and it does not take into consideration the final ranking you earn in a level. With this in mind, if you're finding it too difficult to S rank on first visit, you can even revisit a level and go for just one or two of the categories for S rank, then again for the other two, and the game will assign you S rank for that level.

To get a total Rank of S, not only are you needed to earn all the S ranks, but to also complete the two secret chapters. These chapters have no ranking, and you are just required to complete them.

```
⚠️ Be aware that if you are going for the secret chapters, any hits taken or any amount of time
spent in these secret chapters will count for the rankings in the main chapters, as you're technically still inside it.
If you're thinking of doing S ranks and the secret chapters and at the same time, know that you'll make at least
the time ranking almost impossible to do.

Skellinton's Revenge [10]
Defeat Oogie's Boogie's Shadow without taking damage on Nightmare Mode
```
`CHALLENGE`

* He does a very clear movement when he throws his dices. Immediately dodge them when they're close.
* The Halloween Ghosts can easily be dealt with with Soul Spin. They'll always come back so don't risk going for Soul Slam (△).
* When at the WOW part of the song, be ready to dodge in time the big dices, right when Oogie Boogie's Shadow gets at the third WOW. It may be safer to go for a triple dodge to be safe.

```
`CHALLENGE`

* Be patient and let it attack first. Stay on any of its sides so that he has to turn around to make you more prepared. 
* Against the tiny spiders, charge your ▢ and do Soul Spin to make an even stronger one that'll attract much more spiders, dealing the most amount of damage.
* When it's enraged, the Spider will shoot 3 web projectiles. The exact behaviour is that it'll shoot 2 projectiles one after the other, then after a bit of a pause the tird projectile. It'll also get a bit quicker on its moves.

My Whip Will Slice You! [10]
Defeat Dr. Finkelstein without taking damage on Nightmare Mode
```
`CHALLENGE`

* Going for the fast method is rather risky, considering how easy it is to be hit by the guns. If you don't think you can go for this method, go for the slower one.
* If you want to go for the fast method... Try to throw both pieces of brain in front of Dr. Finklestein. They'll bance off on the ground, but that also puts them much closer to him, and it makes your next attempt faster.
* Guns can be avoided much easier by standing in front of where they're initially pointing. With Soul Robber level 2, you can also destroy them before they can even hit you. Don't try to go for the other guns right after, they WILL hit you most likely.
* Right after the guns retreat, you can try to open Dr. Finkelstein's head by going right behind him before the blades come out. Even if you're not going to throw a piece of brain at him, you can still gain easy notes out of him. This way, if you destroy the blades after, you should have a full bar for the dance segment.

You Faced My Rage [25]
Defeat Lock, Shock and Barrel without taking damage on Nightmare Mode
```
`CHALLENGE`

* You'd want to use a Blue Soul to make the first phase shorter. Watchout for the traps as you go.
* For the second phase to go smothly, you need to make sure to destroy the bathtub while it's correctly positioned close to the edge of the arena (preferably either up or down side). When all three get off the bathtub, change immediately to the Pumpkin King Costume and constantly blast them with Fire Blast (△) making sure to hit all three of them. It may sound easy to do... it may take some trial and error.
* If something went wrong and you could only get 2 or 1 of them, try to lure them to one another and Fire Blast (△) them, but be weary of whoever is free and what they do.

I'm the Only Pumpkin King! [25]
Defeat Oogie Boogie without taking damage on Nightmare Mode
```
`CHALLENGE`

* The tactic is almost the same as the normal one, but the cards will have more health. It'll take a full combo of Soul Robber lvl 3 to destroy one, so be quick and move away from the middle platform when possible (actually, the lvl 3 combo will move you away a bit from the platform, so keep that in mind).
* Don't try to hit the gunners. They won't take off that much health and it's very risky to try and to hit them. You could time a Fire Blast (△) exactly at the moment where they become vulnerable, which is when Oogie says "Joking!", but it's much better to just stay away from them.
* To be extra safe, when you need to throw the exploding dices in his mouth, you have time to throw 2 at him. They won't do extra damage, but it gives you way more empty space to stand in.
* There's nothing much so speed up the fight, except to use a Blue Soul when you make him explode. Mind when the traps and the dice bombs come out and to position yourself correctly to each one of them.

Half-Cold Half-Hot [10]
Defeat the Fire King and Ice King without taking damage on Nightmare Mode
```
`CHALLENGE`

* Fire Blast (△) with the Pumpkin King Costume the both of them. Ice King Skeleton will go down in 2 or 3 hits, while the Fire King Skeleton will stay in place to absorb your Fire Blast, making this very safe.
* Carefully get behind the Fire King Skeleton, use a Blue Soul and finish it off fast. If he becomes black, throw a Re-Possession present at it and keep your distance.

A Filthy Finale [25]
Defeat Mega Oogie 1st Phase without taking damage on Nightmare Mode
```
`COMPLETION` `CHALLENGE`

* Don't try to hit his feet. It makes you an easy target.
* Remember the invincibility extension with the dodge, as it'll be useful to dodge all of his attacks.
* If you don't feel confident or you think you'll get hit, you can fall down and that'll make Mega Oogie stop his attack.
* Make use of the Red Souls with the gas leaks and the Blue Souls to finish the fight quickly. Don't hoard them now!

It's Payback Time! [10]
Get a Full Combo in the dance against Mega Oogie on Nightmare Mode
```
`COMPLETION` `CHALLENGE`

This dance also has that same sequence as the earlier Oogie Boogie boss fight, but in here it is way harder than that. More specifically, the last 2 parts of the dance can caught you off guard if you're not ready.

Smokin' Sexy Style!! [5]
Get a Pumpkin King Combo Rank for the first time [Dances don't count]
```

Perform a total combo of 150 without breaking it to reach **Pumpkin King** combo rank.

You'll have many opportunities to do this, but the easiest to do this is in Chapter 3. Continue until you're trapped in an arena fight with Shock. Perform Soul Cycle (△ Charged), and keep it going using Blue Souls before the Soul Robber becomes red (sometimes the enemies drop a Blue Soul too). When you run out of Blue Souls, keep the combo going by either hitting the enemies with a normal attack or with Soul Spin (↻ Left Stick, ▢).

Fire Hazard [10]
Defeat Mega Oogie 1st Phase without using the Pumpkin King Costume
```
`COMPLETION` `CHALLENGE`

This is an endurance test: you'll lose so much damage by not being able to light the gas leaks, so you'll have to rely entirely on Soul Robber and your ability to survive against all of his attacks. Remember the tips presented in You're King Of Nothing!, and to use your Crystal Bottles

The Speedrun Before Christmas [50]
Beat the game in 3 hours or less [New File, Save File Timer, Any Difficulty]
```
`COMPLETION` `CHALLENGE`

This achievement will be less scary to earn if you've beaten the game already, hence it's right at the bottom of the list.

Below i'll still  be sharing how to beat each level the fastest way. But first, some general tips for this run:
* You can, and must, play on easy mode for this achievement. Easy mode puts enemies on their lowest maximum health, making them faster to defeat.
* Cutscenes and pausing the game will not block the timer. While the ranking screen or the level select screen will block the timer.
* If you didn't like the time you got, you can reset your game and reload it to have a re-do, since it only cares about the timer on the save file.
* You're not obbligated to fight most of the enemies in the game. It'll be written if some are obbligatory, but most of them you can just run away.
* Getting a good rank in each chapter means more souls to spend on upgrades, but it's ultimately not important.
* The only upgrades that you'll ever need are the Soul Robber, maybe the Pumpkin King Costume upgrades if you want to be safe.
* For extra lives, you can get any of the ones that can be found in any area. The ones in Hidden Places or the Witches' Shop are a waste of time.

```
⚠️ This needs to be reiterated: due to this achievement tracking the timer on your save file,
there is no need to do this in a single sitting.
You can actually take your time before going through each level if you need to check what you need to do.

### Chapter 1

[![Speedrun Chapter 1](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/assets/133049176/09940d08-aa91-4b44-8d39-d6d3d81a1c90)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEQ3aKmckXk)

1. Fight the skeletons until Oogie Boogie starts to talk. It'll take you 6 skeletons.

2. The skeletons will continue to spawn endlessly until Oogie Boogie stops talking. Finish them off when he starts laughing.

3. Move immediately in the Town Hall to start the boss fight.

4. Hitting Shadow Oogie does lead to constant damage, but while hitting him, grab some notes so that you'll finish him off fast.

### Chapter 2

1. Talk to Corpse Kid. Optionally replenish your health at the fountain if needed. Then move to the Witches' Shop, which is nord of Corpse Kid.

2. It's unlikely that you'll have anything to buy, so after the cutscene, immediately exit. Talk to Corpse Kid again and enter into the manhole.

3. Defeat the enemies in there and talk to the Clown. Then get out of the manhole through the grapple point.

4. Go to the entrance of Halloween Town, right in front of the fountain, and defeat the enemies that'll appear (their number is actually randomized). Then interact with the gate.

### Chapter 3

1. Go past all the enemies and reach the big dead tree by following the way to the left and talk to Hanging Tree. You can waste a bit of time getting to the golden pumpkin.

2. Then go back to where you entered this area to initiate a fight with Lock. Defeat all the enemies, then interact with the dog house of Zero, next to the entrance to Halloween Town.

3. Find the the Hanging Tree's skeletons throughout the area. The first one is in an enclosed area behind the three. Three are in the next section of the Old Graveyard: the first one is hanging on branch next to the bridge; The second one is south of the Burial Chamber; The third one is a bit before the Burial Chamber, in a tiny area reachable only by a grappling point. Then go back to the first area of the Old Graveyard and climb the dead tree to get to the last skeleton. After saving the last skeleton talk to the Hanging Tree to finish the chapter.
