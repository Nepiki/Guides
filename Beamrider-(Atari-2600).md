## 2) Introduction

Beamrider is probably one of my favourite Atari 2600 games, while I don’t have much experience with the Atari 2600, this game is fantastic. The idea of the game is you are a ship flying through sectors battling your way through until you die. You are on the bottom of the screen while enemies come down from the top and kill you by shooting you or crashing into you. 

## 3) Walkthrough

**Step 1**

_Get 10 lives._

Getting lives in this game should just come naturally while playing. Essentially you get lives bast on your score so the more points you rack up, the more you get. You can also collect some lives so keep an eye out for them.

_Complete Sector 1-5 without losing a life. (Reset must be done if you die)_

This one isn’t too hard however, if you die, you must reset the entire game. Good thing it is only the first 5 sectors! Essentially, just don’t get hit, play carefully, kill the 15 ships in each sector and make your way through.

_Get 100,000 points._

Ah yes, the points. Points are basically the main goal to most Atari 2600 games. So how do you get points? You kill things. Killing various ships will award you points. A great way to get points however is to have ships in your fleet. At the end of each sector, is a sector sentinel, the more ships you have in your fleet when you destroy one, the more bonus points you get when you kill it so try not to die as dying will only make the points achievements that much harder.
