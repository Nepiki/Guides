# Basic Guidelines

- The game can be played either in its original Japanese text or with the help of the English translation.
- Valkyrie can move, jump, and shoot in any of 8 directions.  She loses momentum if she jumps before moving, or tries to change direction in the air.
- Newly acquired weapons are added in the order they are obtained or purchased.  If you already have another weapon, it must be depleted before the new one can be used.  The next weapon in-line(as seen in the pause menu) will be used afterwards.  When all weapons are depleted she reverts back to whichever is her "default weapon".

# Advanced Guidelines

- Completing a stage sets a new password.  The password is shown on the screen before entering the new stage, as well as when you choose Game Over instead of 'Continue'.
- The password that was set is exactly what you will return to if you lose all your lives and continue.  All weapons, the number of lives, most score/"EXP" and money will be the same as it was when you stepped into that Stage.
- The use of the password starting with おまけ or EQd is prohibited, even if you "get" a different password upon completing the stage, the achievements will be disabled until you reset the game back to the title screen.

# Basic Progress
The achievements are in order of progress and stage-specific challenges, followed by all-game challenges.

- The first 7 achievements are basic progress for gradually beating the game.

- You may use passwords to resume play at a later time if you need to stop playing.
- You may use Continue as often as you need to.  Just remember: your 'current password' is always reloaded on using a Continue(this does not count as using-a-password for that specific achievement).

Finishing Basic Progress requires minimal effort as you have nothing to stop you from trying-again except your own patience.  However, you could effectively "brick" yourself if you enter a difficult-stage with minimal gear/lives/money, because that is what you will always restart the same stage with.  If that happens you may want to start a new game and be more careful about what you buy or use on the next attempt.

# Stage Challenges and Collectibles
## Stage 1 Collectibles:
[![Clone Magic](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/342884.png)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/309658) - Valkyrie Clone Wars
   > There are two villager houses in Stage 1, entering both gives a different reward.  The second house contains the Clone Magic spell, but only if you answer a Quiz correctly.
   > > To answer the quiz, or answer to anyone for that matter, hold a D-Pad direction and press a button.  This is also used for shops to buy one of 3 weapons, or exit the shop by holding down.
   > > "Clone Magic" is a useful double-attack that fires two huge orbs in the direction you were facing when you started the attack.
## Stage 2 Collectibles:
[![Cyclone Magic](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/342885.png)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/309659) - The Water Girl
   > Start the stage by taking the left-path at the fork.  As you work your way upwards, you will eventually encounter a boy pleading for water.  This 'water' is up above you - ride the platform to the next island without falling, where a small pool of water is.  A woman will ask you what you want - answer correctly and she will give you the "Cyclone Magic' spell.  Return safely downward from where you came(and yet the boy who wanted water is no longer here).
   > > "Cyclone Magic" is a screen-clearing attack that fires in all directions.

[![Emerald Branch Splash](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/342901.png)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/309675) - Emerald Branch Splash
   > A shop keeper will hint about this; when you buy an item, they tell you that the right most Treant is "wealthy".  When you reach the end of the level, you will be on a small island on the left side of the screen, and there will be floating platforms all around you, to the north, northeast, and east.  If you take the short route, you encounter a 'normal' Treant that is a gray-brown color.  Heading northeast or east-then-immediately-north will cause you to encounter a golden Treant.  However, if you continue east until you can't find another floating platform and then head north, you will encounter an emerald Treant.  Both the gold and emerald Treants drop a weapon unlike the normal treant, and each progressively have more and more HP than the first.
   > > The goal of this achievement is to get the weapon that is dropped, the 4-Way Shot.  This can only be detected if you have a weapon-slot available, however as long as the game is played normally, there shouldn't be any way to fill up all your empty slots before this point.
## Stage 3 Collectibles
[![Eternal Blade](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/343738.png)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/310660) - Sword of Eternia
   > At the start of stage 3, head up to the first path split and continue going up.  You will encounter a chest and a wall - destroy the wall.  Keep going up, and you will encounter another wall.  Destroy that wall.  Keep going up until you enter a chamber with a woman; for saving her, she will give you the Eternal Blade.
   > > If you got the Light Blade at the start of Stage 1, you know what this weapon is like; however, this is a PERMANENT upgrade to your wimpy pea-shooter default-sword.  Whenever you run out of extra weapons, you will always have the larger-hitbox of the Light Blade to fall back on.  Highly recommended to get this for every attempted run in the game.

[![BIG Magic](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/342886.png)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/309660) - BIG Valkus
   > At the start of stage 3, head up until the path splits into two, one going up and one going right.  Head right.  As soon as you encounter lava, look at the upper-wall and begin firing at it until a hole breaks.  Enter the hole and answer the woman's question correctly, she will give you the 'BIG Magic' spell.
   > > BIG Magic is a BIG problem.  Your bigger size comes with it a bigger hitbox: you are not invulnerable and you can be hurt or stunned.  You also can't use your weapons!  The most you can do is stomp to do a screen-damaging attack that, while powerful, doesn't erase enemy projectiles or environmental hazards that still harm you.  You may be able to find a use for it yourself, but as far as I'm concerned, it's a waste of magic points.

[![Purple Dye](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/342887.png)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/309661) - You're Turning Violet, Valkyrie!
   > The woman who gives you the BIG Magic spell tells you about the two dyes necessary to make the Purple Dye.  From her small chamber, head down to the main path and head right; save the NPC here and they will tell you to save another person to the north.  Save that person and they will drop a dye for you.  Keep heading north; eventually you will encounter a shop keeper, and if you buy something they tell you that the remaining dye is inside a wall to the left.  You will see two doors above them, head left and keep heading left as far as you can.  Eventually you will encounter a typical breakable-wall, but instead of a path behind it, you will get a dye that falls out like most coins/items do.
   > > This is not the end, however.  Walk back to the right until you find a pair of floating platforms facing what seems to be an empty wall.  Behind this wall is a path leading to someone who can make the purple dye out of the two that you have.  Doing this will trigger the achievement, giving you 'immunity to lava'.  However, despite being immune to BOILING ROCK, you are still damaged/burned by tiny fire attacks from the boss, which is the only place remaining to benefit from lava-immunity.
