## **Introduction**

Wild Arms 3 was the first game in the Wild Arms series to appear on PlayStation 2.  It followed the success of the franchise on PlayStation and is generally regarded as the highest rated game in the series.  The American-western themed game is set in the desolate world of Filgaia.  You play as four drifters, adventurers who brave the wasteland in search of bounties or personal goals, Virginia Maxwell, Jet Enduro, Clive Winslett and Gallows Carradine.  The team joins together in search of solving the mystery surrounding the decay of the world and ultimately to stop the forces behind it.

The game plays out in a typical JRPG format and is rather linear.  The game loop mostly consists of visiting towns and dungeons to unlock access to more towns and dungeons as the story unfolds.  There is a considerable amount of challenging bonus content in the forms of side quests, puzzles, easter eggs and more.  The game is also extremely boss centric with most dungeons having two or three different bosses with which to contend.  Overall the main story of the game is not especially challenging, but some of the side content is considerably more difficult.

The game using an item based save system that allows saving virtually anywhere and any time.  This will affords easy repeated access to bosses or other challenging sections of gameplay.


## **Set Design**

The overall philosophy for the set was to fully explore all of the content the game has to offer in a single play through and to demonstrate proficiency of the battle mechanics through boss challenges that are uniquely tailored to boss specific gimmicks or themes.  The number of missables may seem staggering at first glance, however the vast majority of them are boss challenges which are easy to not miss.

Due to the fact that the game offers a New Game+ option where only character experience, money and a single mediocre item carry over, the set uses a generous level cap restriction on all of the challenge achievements.  Additionally in a normal play through, when you gain access to your first vehicle to traverse the world, there are places that can be exploited to gain vast amounts of levels and very quickly unbalance the game's difficulty.  To ensure boss challenges are kept appropriately balanced, the level caps beyond that point in the game are kept to 5-10 levels higher than would normally be attained in a typical playthrough for any given boss.  There are also ways to prevent experience gain through status effects, so if a player is approaching an achievement level cap, they can prevent undesired leveling to ensure they remain eligible.

## **Achievement Roadmap**

The achievements are ordered in such a way as to guarantee players know which achievement they should accomplish next, except for the non-missable sidequest content or general agnostic challenge achievements.  During a mastery playthrough, players should expect to primarily stick to the main story line's progression, collection and boss challenge achievements, deviating only to unlock missable side quest content (not necessarily complete it immediately) until just before the final boss.  At that point, the player should finish all additional side content and challenges prior to fighting the final boss and mastering the set.

Due to the level cap restrictions, excessive leveling up and grinding is not needed/intended.  The only way a player can possibly find themselves in a situation where they are unable to accomplish certain boss achievements is by making terrible weapon upgrade choices and not being able to earn enough money and remain under the level cap to correct the mistakes.  This is unlikely, but conceivable.  The challenge achievements are generally very accepting of a diverse number of upgrade builds, but this roadmap will ensure that players understand which upgrades should not be neglected.

**Important Arm upgrades**
The only Arm upgrades needed to accomplish a few of the boss challenges are Clive's SHT upgrade.  By default, Clive is the strongest attacker on the team and SHT will further increase his strength.  His physical attacks and Gallows' Arcana (magic) will be the main sources of damage throughout the run.  Using your money to favor Clive's SHT will ensure you remain well positioned for all potential boss challenge achievements.  It is recommend to also invest in a few upgrades for the other characters, however when money begins to become an issue, priority should be given to Clive's SHT.

**FP System**
The battle system of Wild Arms 3 uses an FP system.  In order to cast Arcana, you must have accumulated a certain amount of FP during the battle.  Using Arcana does not cost FP.  The more FP you have, the more powerful the Arcana will be during the battle.  Additionally, each character has special abilities or can summon a guardian that will cost FP to do.  Each character starts a battle with FP equal to their level, so the higher level you are, the more FP you initially have at your disposal.  It is important to understand that the higher FP you have the more effective that character's spells/summon/attacks will be.

_Description_

The boss in Gallows' intro is the Kesaran Pasaran, four sphere shaped enemies near the end of the Fallen Sanctuary dungeon.  The boss gimmick is that if two or three of the enemies are defeated, the remaining one will resurrect the them.  This is to teach you to use the Extension ability which will multitarget Gallows' Arcana.  The goal of this achievement is to defeat the Kesaran Pasaran without them resurrecting at any point.  In order to do this, attack each of the enemies several times, but be careful to not kill more than one of them.  When Gallows runs out of bullets, it is safer to attack with his physical attack to build up FP as it is less likely to deal significant damage.  Once Gallows has more than 75 Arcana, use the Extension-Refrigerate skill to dispatch the Kesaran Parasan and earn the achievement.
