# Introduction

It was released on March 28, 2001, exclusively in Japan, and is the last Pok√©mon game released for the Game Boy Color.

The game adds many new features not present in the original, such as new cards, the ability to play as a female character, a much more expansive in-game world, and contains nearly all of the cards from Base Set, Jungle, Fossil, and Team Rocket. It also features a more developed story in that, rather than just collecting cards and defeating the Grand Masters, the player must defeat a new villainous team, Team Great Rocket.

# Road Map

Some of the achievements are progression based and can't be missed, or done out of order, but many of them can be done at any time. The missable achievements are mostly events that open up and close at specific points during progression and battles with your Rival that you can only attempt once. They become available when certain conditions are met and you cannot avoid them when they do.

This guide will have the missable achievements listed first in the order they appear in the game for convenience. This will put the missable achievements out of order from the achievement list on RA. The rest will be in the RA order otherwise.
