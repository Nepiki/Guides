**Step 2**
In this step, is basically everything that can be missed, or you can choose not to do. Typically, if you miss these in your first playthrough, you can start over and go strictly for them however since there is so much missible and you only have a single chance to get them, or you have to make choices, I recommend using another save file or, especially for the girls, get their affection up all around the same time, same with the rivals. That way you can trigger their marriages, then reset and reload your game and go for the next one. Therefore I am saying step two is your marriages because there are a lot of achievements that are affected by your marriage and who you marry. This method will cut down greatly on the time needed and the number of play throughs. If you don’t do this method, expect at least 5 play throughs. So as for the “cleanup,” the achievements are as follows:

## 4) Achievements

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138306.png) [Town Introduction]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99513)  
_Have the Mayor show you around town and introduce you to the villagers._  
**-=Missable=-**

This one is rather simple and just takes time. When you first start, when you leave your house, the mayor will be standing there, and you will talk to him. He offers to show you around town, accept and watch it play out. It will use up a few in game hours but it is not big deal. You will be awarded the achievement when the event is over.

_Turn on the TV and watch all the channels._  

Quick and easy, in your house is a TV, the most useful thing for me is the weather but there are multiple channels. Essentially turn it on and flip through them and you’ll be awarded the achievement.

=-----------------------------------------------------------=

![]( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/138304.png) [Slacker!]( https://retroachievements.org/achievement/99515)  
_Take a nap during the day._  

Very easy, if you just stand there and waste away your time not moving, you will eventually lay down and start taking a nap. So just waste your precious minutes of the quick day, drop the controller and let yourself fall asleep. If you really want that time back, just save before and reload so you are not wasting the little time in each day.
