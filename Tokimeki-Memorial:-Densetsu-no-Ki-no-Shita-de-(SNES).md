# Introduction

Tokimeki Memorial is a dating simulation game by Konami, released on multiple platforms in the mid-1990s. It was a commercial and critical success in Japan, but remained obscure elsewhere in the world for many years, as Konami never localized it (or any of its spinoffs/sequels) for other regions. However, in recent years Tokimeki Memorial has had increased exposure to western gamers: first in 2021 with an extensive [video review by Tim “Action Button” Rogers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xb-DtICmPTY), and in 2022 the first ever fully-playable English translation (plus MSU-1 enhancements) courtesy of https://translated.games/. The achievement set was primarily developed using the English translation, but the original Japanese version is supported too.

# Walkthrough / Gameplay Loop

_This section is mostly spoiler-free._  
Rather than present a step-by-step walkthrough per se, it makes more sense to describe Tokimeki Memorial in terms of a gameplay loop. The game contains multiple endings, and it persistently tracks your progress toward seeing all 13 “good” endings. As such, you’ll need to complete no fewer than 13 full playthroughs to master the achievement set.

Let’s outline some core gameplay mechanics common to every playthrough of Tokimeki Memorial.  
### Timeslots
The game’s events span a 3-year calendar, April 1996 through March 1999. You’ll be given a limited number of timeslots of two basic types, "School Days" and "Days Off". The distribution of timeslots on the calendar is the same for every playthrough.  
### Stats
Your character has several stats reflecting their physical, social, and intellectual aptitudes. These stats determine which girls you’ll meet and how much they like you, as well as your performance in special events like festivals and exams. “School day” timeslots are reserved for doing activities that will boost one or more stats. You can also use “Day off” timeslots to boost stats with a significant bonus, but doing so means sacrificing day-off-exclusive activities like dating.
### Clubs
Your character can choose to join one of several school clubs. Doing so is optional, but it’s usually a good idea. Clubs provide special stat-boosting activities, boost your reputation with the girl who’s in the club with you, and lead to a few unique events/cutscenes. Each girl except for Mira, Yuko, Megumi, and Yumi will be a member of one club. Shiori’s club membership varies depending on her birthday, while the others are predetermined.
### Meeting girls
Your character starts the game only knowing one girl, Shiori. The other girls have to be met (or “unlocked”) over time. Some girls will be met semi-randomly once you raise their favorite stat to a certain threshold. Other girls are met through more specific ingame events. Protip: If you’ve joined a club that one of the dateable girls is in, doing your club activity will give you a higher chance of an initial meeting with that girl, while also preventing you from meeting any other girl during that week. Use this strategically!  
### Dating
Once you meet a girl (and call Yoshio to get her phone number), you can use a “Day off” timeslot to invite her out on a date, which will be scheduled for a subsequent day off. Invitations are one of the game’s more RNG-dependent mechanics; no matter how much a girl likes you, there’s never a 100% chance she’ll accept. (Anecdotally, I think you have a higher chance of a Yes if you set the date further out from the current day, but this is unconfirmed.) Depending on your choice of date location and dialog responses, you’ll either gain or lose affection with your date partner. Sometimes you’ll see a unique “event date” if you match up specific combinations of girl, location, and calendar season.  
### Bomb Warnings
You may receive periodic notifications that unsavory rumors are circulating about your character. This means one or more girls are about to “bomb” you. This generally occurs when too much time has passed since you’ve interacted with someone. When you get a bomb warning, you’ll need to quickly arrange a date with the girl in question, as a detonation will lower your affection with _every_ girl. Due to this mechanic, it’s wise to limit the number of girls you meet in each playthrough; girls you haven’t met can’t set bombs. I recommend trying to limit your meetings to no more than 2-3 girls (besides Shiori and Yumi) per playthrough.  
### Endings
When you reach the final day of the ingame calendar, you’ll see one of several ending cutscenes based on how you performed throughout your playthrough. Each girl has a unique “good ending” that can trigger if you have both a high affection level with her and have raised your stats above specific thresholds. Each time you see a new good ending, a “heart” counter on your save file will increment, and you’ll be prompted to start a fresh playthrough. Your biggest overarching goal while mastering the achievement set will be to gain 13 hearts on a single save file.

# Spoiler Warning

This guide contains spoilers beyond this point. If you haven’t played Tokimeki Memorial at all yet, I highly recommend completing one playthrough on your own before referring back here for more detailed information.  
Also, there will be some "TBD" notices regarding gameplay details I have yet to fully confirm. It's a complicated game!

# Achievements I: Meet the Girls

Meeting each of the dateable girls will unlock an achievement. It is *not* advisable to try meeting as many girls as possible in a single playthrough, due to the bombing mechanic.

> Watch the prologue to meet Shiori Fujisaki.  

The game technically considers you to have “met” Shiori no matter what, but choosing to watch the intro shows you her only proper introductory cutscene.

> Meet Mio Kisaragi.

Mio can be met in three ways:
* Randomly during a school week if your Culture stat is ≥40 in the 1st school year or ≥80 in the 2nd school year. This type of meeting cannot happen in the 3rd school year.
* Doing the club activity for either the Drama Club or the Literary Club. Mio will be randomly assigned to one of these two clubs at the beginning of each playthrough, though she might be overridden by Shiori. [TBD: I'm not sure whether this can happen in the 3rd school year.]
* Randomly at the Christmas Eve party, if you have not already met at least two girls besides Shiori.

![Badge: The Shy Girl](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/305076.png) [The Shy Girl](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/275674) (2)
> Meet Megumi Mikihara.

If you have a high affection level with Shiori, there's a random chance you'll meet Megumi on either Valentine’s Day or Christmas Eve (even if you're turned away from the party). This can happen in any year, so you’ve got 6 chances total.

![Badge: The Sisterly Girl](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/305084.png) [The Sisterly Girl](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/275682) (1)
> Meet Yumi Saotome.

Yumi is the only girl besides Shiori who you’re guaranteed to meet in every playthrough. She will always introduce herself on the first day of the 2nd school year, April 4th 1997. Also like Shiori, you’ll automatically know her phone number as soon as you meet her.

# Achievements II: Events

There are three types of special events (cutscenes) you can see for each girl.
### Seasonal
Each dateable girl has four event dates you can trigger by taking her to a certain location during a certain season. Unlike real life, the seasons align cleanly with calendar months. Spring is March-April-May, Summer is June-July-August, Fall is September-October-November, and Winter is December-January-February. Some seasonal event dates also require a high affection level; if you take a girl to the right location during the right season and don’t get the event, just try again once your affection is higher.
### School
Each girl has one event that can trigger randomly during school days. For better or worse this is another RNG-heavy part of the achievement set; even after 13+ playthroughs I’m still uncertain which elements of the game state (if any) influence the likelihood of seeing these events. On average I saw school events for about 2-3 girls per playthrough.
### SFC
Each girl also has one extra event date that’s exclusive to the Super Famicom version of Tokimeki Memorial; I call these “SFC Events”. These each involve a small minigame, though actually winning said minigame is not required for the achievements.

There are a lot of these to unlock, but the good news is that you can (and probably will) see multiple events for multiple girls per playthrough.

## Where's Shiori's SFC event, and Yumi's school and SFC events?
I have not been able to confirm the existence of an SFC event for Shiori; it may be that one was simply never implemented in the game. If you have information otherwise, please let me know!  
Yumi does have both school and SFC events, but their occurance is disproportionately rare compared to those of the other girls, to the point that I decided to omit them from the achievement set as a potential RNG-unwelcome-concept issue. Yumi's school event is unique in that it requires high affection with both Yumi _and_ Saki, and you have to have already seen Saki's school event within the same playthrough. Yumi's SFC event can happen randomly on New Years' day after meeting her, but with an unusually low probability of triggering; even if you have a high affection level, she will usually just invite you to the Shrine like anyone else would.

# Achievements III: Endings

The end of the game is always on March 31st, 1999. Each girl has different requirements to trigger their “good” ending (a confession under the Tree of Legends). In the event you’ve met the requirements for multiple girls’ endings during a single playthrough, the game will choose whoever you have the highest affection level with. (Your affection ratings are more granular than just the 7 levels you see in Yoshio’s notebook.)  
The first 11 endings listed below each require some combination of your stats to be at a minimum threshold. They may also require you to pass a certain level of university/career exam (administered about five weeks before graduation). As of this writing I have yet to confirm what all of these requirements actually are - doing so will take several hours of testing. What I _have_ confirmed is that if you've managed to find one of the other text guides available online covering other versions of the game (PC Engine, PlayStation, etc), then great news! The stat requirements _do not_ match precisely between versions. They'll be _close_, but don't be surprised if you have to grind some stat more or less in this version than you would on PlayStation.

> Meet the elusive Miharu Tatebayashi under the Tree of Legends.

Miharu cannot be met and dated like most of the other girls. Her ending will occur if you have at least one other girl at the highest affection level, but have not met the stat and/or career requirements for their ending.

> Become close to Rei Ijuin and learn more about them.

I left this achievement’s description vague to avoid spoiling too much, but yes, Rei is a  confession candidate. The conditions for this ending are rather unique: you just need to call Rei on the phone. A lot. The exact number of calls required is unclear, but it’s a reliable strategy to simply call Rei with _every_ Day Off timeslot for an entire playthrough. As far as I know, your stats and relationships with other characters do not matter. You’ll know you’re on track if you see at least three unique events with Rei prior to the end of the playthrough.

> Re-re-do high school to earn 13 hearts in your album.

This one is simple, albeit time-consuming. Your save file has a “Hearts” counter which tracks the number of unique confession endings you’ve seen, and this achievement requires reaching the maximum of 13 (for the 11 dateable girls, plus Miharu and Rei.) In order to earn multiple hearts, you must save your game using the prompt that appears immediately after the credits, and then start a new playthrough using the same save file. As such, it’s not possible to save time by rolling back to partially-complete save backups; this truly requires 13 start-to-finish playthroughs, so buckle up. Fortunately, you’re free to complete the endings in any order.

# Achievements IV: Miscellaneous

This section covers all the ingame events which aren’t tied to any specific girl.

> Score over 350 points in the school exams.

School exam scores appear to be based on the sum of your Art, Culture, and Logic stats.

> Score over 470 points in the school exams.

Again, just grind your Art, Culture, and Logic stats. It will likely take until the 3rd school year to be able to score this high.

> Place 1st in the 100 Meter Race at the Sports Festival.

This is a simple minigame of rapidly alternating A and B button presses. However, even if you do the inputs perfectly, your speed is capped by your Fitness stat, so you'll need to grind that a bit beforehand.

![Badge: Bound To Win](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/305096.png) [Bound To Win](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/275694) (5)
> Place 1st in the Three-Legged Race at the Sports Festival.

Very similar to the 100 Meter Race, just a different input pattern - press A and B in rhythm with the onscreen prompts, not as quickly as possible. You will still need a high Fitness stat, too.

![Badge: Throwing The Game](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/305098.png) [Throwing The Game](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/275696) (3)
> Win the Ball Toss at the Sports Festival.

This minigame is technically possible to win with a low Fitness stat, but becomes significantly easier as your Fitness increases, as doing so increases the width of the target you're aiming at.

![Badge: Thanks, I'll Pass](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/305097.png) [Thanks, I'll Pass](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/275695) (2)
> Win the Ball Race at the Sports Festival.

This is by far the easiest Sports Festival minigame. Your Fitness stat influences how far the ball travels per throw, but even if your Fitness is paltry, you can still win consistently with well-timed inputs.

![Badge: Love In This Club](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/305093.png) [Love In This Club](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/275691) (1)
> Join a school club.

This can be done on any Sunday from the school icon in the main menu. Any club will do.

![Badge: The Boss Of This World](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/305094.png) [The Boss Of This World](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/275692) (5)
> Defeat a challenging enemy with the help of your club ability.

There are a few steps required to reach the special event for this achievement.
1. Join any club, ideally as early in a playthrough as possible.
2. Do the club activity... a lot. There’s a hidden “club” stat that you’ll need to grind to a very high value, which will likely take until your 2nd or 3rd school year. This will reset if you change clubs mid-playthrough.
3. Once your club stat is high enough, you’ll see a message and animation announcing you’ve unlocked a special ability, the purpose of which isn’t immediately obvious.
4. The next time you take any girl out on a date, you’ll be interrupted by a mock RPG battle. (Note that this will cancel any date events you would have seen otherwise.) To win the battle, use your Special ability as often as you can, and use the Defend command when the boss does a "Sleeve Dragon" attack. The cooldown timings work out such that you'll usually settle in to a simple rotation of Attack, Defend, Special, repeat.
