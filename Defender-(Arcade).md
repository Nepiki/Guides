## About the Author

Hi! I'm Wes, the author of the RetroAchievements set for Defender. My fascination with this iconic game began in my childhood, when my father purchased a well-maintained arcade cabinet from a local dentist. He'd play Defender to unwind after a long day at work, and together, we'd spend hours enjoying the game to the beats of classic 80s hits. We kept things engaging by creating various challenges, like seeing who could survive on one life through an entire song or limiting ourselves to only 5 lives and 5 smart bombs.

As time went on, our skills and scores improved, and during my college years, I finally surpassed the million-point mark. This achievement sparked my interest in competitive arcade gaming, leading me to participate in [Donkey Kong high score competitions](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/05/is-this-the-worlds-first-perfect-game-of-donkey-kong/). Although I'm grateful for my experiences with Donkey Kong, Defender will always hold a special place in my heart. I hope you find this guide helpful and that it ignites the same passion for this classic game in you.

In Defender, you pilot a spaceship tasked with defending humanoids from alien invaders across a horizontally-scrolling terrain. Featuring a unique radar screen and the ability to thrust in both directions, Defender brought an unprecedented level of control and strategy to the gaming world.

This game comprises of multiple waves of increasing difficulty, with varied alien adversaries attempting to abduct the humanoids scattered across the landscape. Your mission is to protect them by eliminating the alien threat while avoiding collisions and hostile fire. Strategic use of your ship's arsenal, including the powerful smart bomb, is essential for success.

The intense action, steep learning curve, and intricate controls make Defender an undeniably challenging experience. However, mastering its gameplay is an incredibly rewarding accomplishment, akin to learning a dead language. By the end of this guide, I hope to empower you with the skills and knowledge needed to conquer the alien invasion and defend the humanoids with confidence.
