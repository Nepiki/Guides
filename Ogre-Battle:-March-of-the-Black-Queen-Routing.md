## Routing

Savior of the World: Most of the unlockable in the game require you to have a high reputation and a main lord with high ALI. With that in mind plus the fact that it's way easier to tank your reputation/ALI than raise it, most of the game need to be played with a good aligned lord. Liberate towns with high ALI units, choose the benevolent answer to questions and try to only fight higher level enemies with your lord. Check the notes on Reputation and Alignment/Charisma for more info on how to manipulate it.

When you begin the game, your choice of answer to the quiz will net you one of 4 lords archetype. Thanks to nicely coded achievement your gender doesn’t matter so chose what you want (male is the canon choice if you care about those things). I would recommend getting the IceCloud  or Iainuki lord as they have the highest starting ALI. I personally started with the IceCloud male lord for the global hit attack and the extra starting clerics.

**Pogrom's Forest**

-   Undead such as Ghost and Skeleton can only get killed by characters using White attacks. This early in the game it should mainly be your Clerics, a front facing main lord if you have the IceCloud one or any character with a White weapon (such as the axe you got in Lake Jansenia or a mace you can obtain in this map). This is a good place to grind a bit if you want to raise ALI/CHA of some units.

But wait, what do you mean 9/10 ?  For the last ending you need to do begin a new game and put FIRESEAL as your Lord name. This will bring you to the bonus map (which is canonically speaking a battle taking place after Balmorian Ruins and see you play the legendary hero Lexar as he goes to defeat a reincarnation of Albeleo.)
