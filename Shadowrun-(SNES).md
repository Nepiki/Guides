## General Tips

**No need to hire Shadowrunners**
- They die very easily and aren't that useful.
- The good ones are very expensive, and by the time you can afford them, you should already be strong enough to protect yourself.
- To avoid missing the second missable achievement.

**Save time for the max-stats achievements**
1. Just grind for enough Karma to max one of your stat. Do not spend it.
2. Save your game first.
3. Spend the Karma to max that stat, to earn the achievement for that specific stat.
4. Load your game, and spend the Karma on another stat.

## Beat the Arena

There is an `Arena` at the `Caryards` area, you will need to beat all the stages for achievement completion. The first few stages aren't that difficult, but the last few stages can get quite tough if you aren't prepared. If you are having trouble beating the later stages, you can come back later in the game when you are better equipped. Winning the Arena will reward you with a lot of Karma and money.
