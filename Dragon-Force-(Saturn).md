## **Introduction**

Dragon Force was one of the most highly rated games on Saturn. It is a strategy-RPG where you select a kingdom and play through a non-linear, unique campaign to unite the other seven monarchs of Legendra and form the Dragon Force. Only then can the dark god Madruk, who is threatening all of mankind, be challenged and defeated. The game features both campaign-level map conquest as you move armies between strategic locations including castles, towns, shrines and towers as well as real time battles opposing forces lead by generals command up to 100 troops each. The game boasts one of the best sound tracks in retro gaming history with almost all of the music being extremely well made.


## **Set Design**

Due to the non-linear design of the game, there is significant variety between play throughs and even more variety between selected kingdoms. In order to provide exposure to the game's full content, it was determined that play throughs of each kingdom, focusing on their unique aspects would be the most appropriate course of action. As such, each kingdom has over 20 kingdom-specific achievements that can only be unlocked during its specific play through and an additional 39 achievements that can be earned while playing as any kingdom.

Each kingdom offers a unique experience and potential for a different approach to the conquest portion of the game. As such, the set was designed to maximize players' exposure to the aspects that differentiate each kingdom. Kingdom-specific achievements are a mix of progression and challenge achievements.


## **Compatibility**

The achievements require the following linked hash:

Dragon Force (USA) ![](https://retroachievements.org/Images/labels/redump.png)<br>
acb9d7194d31fb2ea6967fce3558efe1


## **Achievements**

When playing through the set, focus only on the achievements available to whichever kingdom you selected as well as the achievements marked [Any]. Nearly all of the missable achievements are quite straight forward to set up if following a general outline. A good practice for each kingdom is to recruit Vlad at the earliest opportunity and follow this guide's recommendations for fulfilling the kingdom-specific Zanon storylines. Additionally, whenever you intend to fight an opposing monarch, ensure your monarch is part of the invading force. These two simple rules of thumb will cover the vast majority of missable achievements.

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/270425.png) **[Highland] Lead By Example** (3 points)

_Win a duel with Wein_

During battle, after all troops are killed the surviving generals will be given an option to duel each other. With Wein as your general, win a duel.

***

***

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/270427.png) **[Highland] Mistaken Identity** (2 points)

_Resolve the misunderstanding and recruit the rebel thief Hilga_

Hilga starts on the town just northwest of Highland castle. Deploy a force to defeat her in battle and capture her. If she retreats while her health is not low enough, she will not be captured and instead run. If this happens, reengage her and try again. After she is captured, she will automatically join your force at the next domestic session.

***

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/272548.png) **[Highland] Purse Snatcher** (2 points)

_Subdue Hikkis and recruit him_

Hikkis start off in Galfiel castle which is immediately west of Highland castle. Defeat and capture him in battle and during a domestic session, grant him audience as a captive and he will join your force.

***

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/270431.png) **[Highland] The Flash Knights** (5 points)

_Enlist the service of the Flash Knights, Ogredd and Lone_

The Flash Knights are guarding the outskirts of Travan castle. Defeat Ogredd and Lone in battle to capture them and they will join during the next domestic session. Note, in order to get the missable achievement [Highland] A Knife in Borgon's Back[m], redirect the army that defeated Ogredd and Lone during their victory animation (pause if needed) back to one of your castles. If you fail to do this, retreat from the fight against Borgon's forces before entering into battle with any of them. You will need to wait for the next domestic session for Ogredd and Lone to join for that missable achievement.

***

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/270413.png) **[Highland] A Knife in Borgon's Back [m]** (10 points)

_Defeat Borgon and his two henchmen, Diablo and Faliel, in a single encounter with Ogredd and Lone in your party. Ogredd and Lone must each win at least one battle, lose none and Ogredd must be the one to kill Borgon on the battlefield_

After you have recruited Ogredd and Lone, deploy them and anyone else you wish, to attack Travan castle. During the battle Borgon, Diablo and Faliel must all be part of the enemy force and will be only unless you previously fought and killed some of them. I recommend using Lone to defeat the weakest enemy general and only use Ogredd to fight Borgon himself.  Utilize other generals such as Wein and Rudger to defeat any other enemy generals.  Borgon has low health and will not retreat, so Ogredd should not have a problem defeating him.

***

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/270416.png) **[Highland] An Old Friend [m]** (5 points)

_Win the support of the Palemoon kingdom without fighting Teiris_

The easiest way to get this achievement is to have Wein engage any Palemoon general in battle. Instead of fighting, the Palemoon empire will join forces with Highland. Another method is waiting for the next domestic session after encountering at least one Palemoon general with any of your generals, but do not fight Teiris herself. At the next domestic session, Palemoon will join Highland. The only way to miss this achievement is to fully capture Teiris during the same week in which you initially encounter any Palemoon general. It is very unlikely you would do this without deliberately attempting it as it would be quite challenging and heavily luck dependent.

***

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/270421.png) **[Highland] Gaining Momentum** (10 points)

_Annex three kingdoms as Highland and gain the support of their monarchs_

Required progression - Once three opposing monarchs have joined your force either voluntarily as likely with Palemoon or after capturing them and waiting until they join at the next domestic session, this achievement will trigger.

***

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/270428.png) **[Highland] Mystery at the Shadow Tower** (5 points)

_Visit the Shadow Tower and receive news of Scythe and Gaul's disappearance_

Required progression - After a progress related domestic event where your advisor discusses the Shadow Tower, visit it with Wein. It is located north of the large lake which is northwest of Topaz castle. During the Shadow Tower event, you will meet Ramda and upon exiting the tower learn of Scythe and Gaul's disappearance automatically.

***

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/270418.png) **[Highland] Clash of the Swords [m]** (10 points)

_Resist Goldark's ambush and defeat him_

When you are nearly finished gathering the other monarchs, with the exception of Goldark, he will disappear at some point and then subsequent reappear and immediately enter battle with Wein. This achievement requires Wein to defeat Goldark during that ambush and not retreat from the battle. In order to ensure you are fully prepared always keep Wein's troop count maxed as the timing of Goldark's ambush cannot be precisely predicted after he disappears.

***

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/271066.png) **[Highland] Damsel in Distress [m]** (10 points)

_Rescue Teiris from Ryskim with Zanon's help_

To get this event, you must have recruited Vlad and defeated Ryskim with him after Ryskim's first appearance. Additionally, you must have encountered Zanon and gotten at least one domestic event discussing him - that will happen immediately after Wein's first encounter with Zanon (retreating is fine). Do not fully complete Zanon's storyline before getting this achievement as he will disappear and Ryskim will not reappear and kidnap Teiris. When Ryskim does kidnap Teiris, simply engage and defeat him.

***

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/270433.png) **[Highland] To Seal the Dark Sword** (10 points)

_Witness Zanon kill himself to seal the dark sword Eclisis_

This event is the finale of Zanon's storyline in the Highland campaign. It will trigger after several iterations of field encounters with Zanon and domestic events. The Zanon storyline requires an engagement with Wein to begin and then will subsequently alternate between domestic events and additional encounters. Some other progression events are required to progress the Zanon storyline, so be patient as it unfolds. It can be accomplished as late in the game as collecting the sacred weapons from the shrines.

***

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/270422.png) **[Highland] High Command** (25 points)

_Unite all members of the Dragon Force under Wein's command_

Required progression - This will trigger once Goldark joins the Dragon Force during the sacred weapon collecting timeframe of the campaign.

***

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/271143.png) **[Highland] Sword of Swords** (5 points)

_Equip the legendary Star Dragon Sword_

Required progression - After Katmando has begun to move and Wein and Goldark recover the Stargem sword from the Northern Shrine, Ramda will attack Katmando. Following the battle Ramda will transform the Stargem sword into the Star Dragon Sword. If Wein is already equipped with the Stargem sword, the achievement will pop at that point. If not, equip him with it during the next domestic session.

***

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/271144.png) **[Highland] Broken Machine** (10 points)

_Destroy Katmando after receiving the Dragon Power from Miral and equipping the Star Dragon Sword_

Required progression - Wein will receive the Dragon Power from Miral after visiting the Northern Shrine with Goldark. Wein must have the Star Dragon Sword equipped in order to damage Katmando.

***

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/270432.png) **[Highland] The Kindness of the Heavens** (25 points)

_Defeat Madruk in his final form with Wein and return peace to Legendra_

Required progression - Use soldier, monk, samurai or dragon troops against Madruk for best results. This achievement will pop upon completion of the game as Highland.

***

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/270430.png) **[Highland] Thanks For Nothing [m]** (1 point)

_Present an award to Rudger, Galam, Nina or Link without them having won a battle_

Simply award one of the aforementioned generals that has not yet won a battle during a domestic session. This is only missable if all of them have won a battle before having been presented an award.

***

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/270424.png) **[Highland] Highland's Round Table** (10 points)

_Deploy an army consisting of Wein, Rudger, Galam, Nina and Link and engage another army. Each of them must win at least one battle and lose none_

The most difficult part of this achievement is finding an enemy force with at least five generals. Typically large groups of generals can be found guarding castles or conducting offensive attacks in the region between Fandaria, Topaz, Izumo and Tradnor. When you are ready for this achievement, deploy the required army with max troops around this area and look for either a deployed army or castle with at five or more generals. Ensure each of your generals wins at least once and does not retreat or get defeated in any battles during the engagement.

***

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/270429.png) **[Highland] Strong Supporting Cast** (10 points)

_Win 20 battles between Rudger, Galam, Nina and Link_

When the total number of battle wins accumulated between the four aforementioned generals, this achievement will trigger.

***

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/270414.png) **[Highland] A Man's Job** (10 points)

_With an army of only Wein, Teiris and Junon, engage and enemy force of at least two generals. Win the battles only using Wein_

Once Palemoon and Tristan have been annexed, deploy an army of only Wein, Teiris and Junon and fight an enemy force of two or more generals. Wein must single handedly win all battles.

***

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/270420.png) **[Highland] Field Marshal** (5 points)

_Have Wein command 100 troops at once_

_Kill more than 30 enemy troops with Lyria's Holy Blast skill_

The Holy Blast skill always targets the center of the battlefield regardless where the troops are located.

_Win at least five battles with each of Palemoon's four primary generals, Gulen, Manoa, Duran and Reiner_

Use these generals fairly early in the campaign to ensure they get enough battles to acrue enough victories. Once one has five, it is not recommended to use them unless needed to ensure other generals have enough battle opportunities remaining.

In order to ensure you are fully prepared always keep Mikhal's troop count maxed as the timing of Goldark's ambush cannot be precisely predicted after he disappears.

***

_Rescue Shione from Ryskim with Zanon's help_

To get this event, you must have recruited Vlad and defeated Ryskim with him after Ryskim's first appearance. Additionally, you must have encountered Zanon and gotten at least one domestic event discussing him - that will happen immediately after Mikhal's first encounter with Zanon (retreating is fine). Do not fully complete Zanon's storyline before getting this achievement as he will disappear and Ryskim will not reappear and kidnap Shione. When Ryskim does kidnap Shione, simply engage and defeat him.

_With an army of only Mikhal and his troops, defeat an opposing force consisting of at least three generals_

_Win a battle with Mikhal using the Breach tactic_

The Breach tactic is used to cross the battlefield as quickly as possible. It is most effective against a ranged opponent, but simply having a superior number of troops is sufficient for this achievement most cases.

***

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/271163.png) **[Izumo] The Shogun and the Field Marshal** (10 points)

_With an army of only Mikhal having 100 samurai troops and Wein having 100 soldiers, defeat an enemy force of at least four generals.  Mikhal and Wein must each win at least two battles and not lose any_

Target an enemy force with an inferior troop count.  Look for enemy forces of four generals in the area between Fandaria, Topaz, Izumo and Tradnor. It is recommended to first annex Bozack and then Highland during the campaign to quickly recruit Wein with enough time to prepare for this achievement while enemy forces still possess large numbers of generals.

***

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/271168.png) **[Izumo] Warriors' Heiko [m]** (10 points)

_Win three battles with each of Izumo's four main generals, Zagat, Jackal, Shione and Mistal, but do not let any have more than one win more than any other at any time_

The goal of this achievement is to get all four generals to three wins, but never letting one get too far ahead of the others.  The way to do this is to ensure all generals get one win before any of them get a second win.  Then ensure they all get to two without anyone getting to three first. Lastly, get to three wins with each of them. Losses are not a factor in this achievement so retreat from battle if necessary to prevent an unwanted win. This achievement will be missed if any of the four main generals has more than a 1 win lead at any time prior to unlocking.

_Defeat a dragon general with Zagat, Jackal or Mistal_

The Tradnor general, Gigg will most likely be the easiest dragon general to encounter, especially early on. Just prior to the final phase of the campaign, however, many dragon generals will roam the map giving you easy access to engage any of them at your convenience.

_Have Zagat, Jackal or Mistal command dragon troops in battle_

Use a Dragon Crest item on any of these generals to enable them to command dragon troops, then switch to dragon troops and begin a battle. Dragon Crests can be found by searching in Crystal castle during the domestic phase.

_Using an army of four ninja generals, win an engagement against a force of at least four enemy generals. Each ninja must win at least once and nose lose any battles_

Any general that can use the Assassin Star skill or looks like a ninja such as Hayate, Shirox, Shione or any of the generic ninja generals will work for this achievement. A good place to find an enemy force of at least 4 generals is in the area between Fandaria, Topaz, Izumo and Tradnor kingdoms.

***

![image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/271159.png) **[Izumo] Rising Daimyo** (5 points)

_Have Zagat, Jackl or Mistal command 100 samurai troops at once before Mikhal is able to command 100 samurai_

Use awards to raise any of the three aformentioned generals max samurai troops to 100 and actually recruit 100 before you award Mikhal enough times such that he is able to command 100. The achievement will lock as soon as Mikhal is able to command 100 samurai after presenting the award, so stay at 90 or less until this achievement is unlocked.
