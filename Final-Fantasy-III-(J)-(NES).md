:no_entry: **\*\* MAY CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS \*\*** :no_entry:

Note that the names of characters, places, etc. used in this guide are based off of the [Chaos Rush translation](https://www.romhacking.net/translations/4760/), which is closest to the official Square Enix translation for FFIII on the Nintendo DS. When possible, I will try to use both names with the Chaos Rush name first followed by the early translation in parentheses.

It will appear like this, as an example:
<br>Gysahl(Gisahl)

* 30 story achievements earned naturally through the course of gameplay
* 22 side quest achievements earned by going to out-of-the-way locations and talking to various NPCs
* 8 challenge achievements, all of which are missable, that requires less-than-ideal party configurations
* 10 grind achievements that will require extensive work to achieve

## Side Quest Achievements

`Share a Potion with a citizen in need.`

Considered a side quest as you aren't required to speak to this old man in the village of Ur at the beginning of the game. If you talk to all NPCs though, you shouldn't have a problem with getting this and the remaining side quest achievements.

`Claim your prize for riding a chocobo around the continent.`

You can meet the requirements for the side quest immediately upon finding your first chocobo in the Chocobo Forest outside of the Village of the Ancients(Ancients' Village). Simply run around the outside ring of the continent and then enter the Village and speak to a child in town to get your prize and the achievement. You don't even have to talk to the kid before hand.

[The Grass is Greener Here](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43017)

`Find the farming town of Gysahl(Gisahl).`

After saving the Floating Continent from falling, you can sail to this town. You aren't required to come here, but you may want to if you don't want to use a Thief during your game.

![Fat Chobobo sprite](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/44127.png)
[You're Gonna Carry That Weight](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43019)

`Meet the Fat Chocobo.`

Use a Gysahl Green(Carrot) at a spot that smells like chocobos to make the Fat Chocobo appear. While this is optional, you will probably unlock this as a result of managing your items during the course of the game.

[Is This Safe to Drink...?](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43029)

`Receive a gift from a reclusive chemist.`

After saving the Elder(Eldest) Tree, don't forget to go back to Castle Argus(Argass) to the locked room on the top-left side of the castle's rampart. A white mage will be there to give you a gift.

![Evoker sprite](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/44142.png) [Welcome to Summoning 101](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43038) and ![Bard sprite](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/44141.png) [The Musical Kingdom](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43039)

`Find the village of Replito(Leprit).` and `Find the village of Duster(Dastar).`

As soon as the Enterprise is freed from it's chain, you can visit these towns. Be wary of flying near the castle of Saronia(Salonia), however, or you will have to remember to find one or both of these towns after that storyline is concluded.

![Dragoon sprite](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/44143.png) [We're Gonna Have to Jump](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43040)

`Ransack the Dragon Spire(Tower).`

While you don't have to do this as part of the story, it'll definitely make your battles in Saronia(Salonia) that much easier with all the loot you get here. You'll find the Dragon Spire in the southeastern section of the city.
