He will tell you that the Cloud Gate was stolen but lost during delivery to the client and give you the rough location for 5000 Credits. Return to Loud in Raizeltown and he will tell you to find the Salvage Ship east of Peppermint. There you will find Aleph in the workshop. For 15k Credits he will make your ship suitable for underwater endeavors. While Aleph works on your ship go talk to Rag then return to Aleph.
Now you can access 7 diving spots that are close to the Salvage Ship in the dark water. One in the North, one in the northeast, one in the east, two in the south, two in the northwest. One of the northwest diving spots contains the Cloud Gate. (Make sure to acquire the Gold Bracelet, Royal Crown, Divine Sword and Diamond Ring first or you will miss out on them)
While playing the Echolocation Minigame make sure to head towards the target that appears twice in a row and is thereby steady or else you will reach a random Treasure Spot.
