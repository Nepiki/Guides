## 2) Introduction

Battlezone is an Atari game, it is very basic, very short and the concept really is points and that’s pretty much it. It overall feels very prototype. You drive a tank and you have enemy tanks which you got to destroy before they destroy you. There is also some alien ship that you can destroy as well. Overall I wasn’t going to bother making a guide for this but I am doing it more for guides completion sake.

## 3) Walkthrough

**Step 1**

The first step is the play the game. You should be able to get everything on a single playthrough though if you die at the start, then you may need to play again. Because there are so few achievements, everything will be lumped into this one step:

**{Story related}**

Since the game is all about points, it is essentially the only “story related” stuff there is. Essentially shoot the enemy tanks and get points. There are several different types of enemies (4 different in total) with the spaceships seeming to be worth the most. They are harder to hit but give you a good number of points. Just keep killing and eventually you’ll get there.

_Get to 10,000 points without dying. (Must reset if you fail)_

I recommend going for this on your first playthrough, it is not to difficult to get but a random shot can ruin it. Keep an eye on your radar to see where the enemies are. If you find you find yourself struggling, try driving backwards! I find it is a lot easier to dodge enemy shots as you are driving away from them making it take longer for their shots to hit you. This method can also help you stay alive longer when going for the other achievements. Just make sure you do a complete reset of the game if you mess this up, otherwise it will not trigger.
