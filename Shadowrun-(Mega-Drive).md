# General Guide

The achievements can be grouped into a few types.
- Story Achievements (these cannot be missed.)
- Side Quests (There are 2 side quests in the game. They can be attempted at any time in the game.)
- Shadowruns (One achievement for each of the shadowrun types.)
- Matrix (Log into different systems, obtain data and crash CPU.)
- Other collectibles (Like collect all contacts, buy specific items, etc.)

Below are some tips or roadmap to follow
- Any starting class is fine, it only affects the very early stage of the game. You can always hire companions to complement your team.
- Hire any shadowrunner for the short term, then sell their items for easy money.
- Buy the `Predator Pistol` and `Armor Jacket` as soon as possible.
- Try to raise your `Reputation` to 5, then buy the `Ork Armband` as soon as possible.
- Try to raise your `Electronics` to 5. Buy `Invisibility` (or hire `Ricky`) to repeat early Corp Runs from `Mortimer Reed`.
- If you are feeling adventurous, you can try to complete the `Stark` side quest and get him to join your party.
- Buy the contact from `Mortimer Reed`, and save up 20,000 nuyen and buy the `Lvl 5 Maglock Passkey`.
- Grind mid-level Corp Runs (from `Celeb` or `Julius`), and save up to buy the `Fuchi Cyber-5` Cyberdeck. You should have a full permanent party member about now, let them stay in party to earn karma for them too.
- Depending on your confidence level, either repeat the mid-level Matrix Run or the Renraku Corp Run from `Celeb` to earn money and karma while upgrading your deck.
- Focus on the Cyberdeck's `Response` and `Masking`. Once you are confident enough, start grinding high-level Matrix Run (from `Celeb`) for money and karma. You will need a lot of money and karma to complete all the achievements.
- Just grind the high-level Matrix Run until you are feeling confident to finish the main plot of the game. It is up to you whether to grind for all the achievements first, or finish the game first and come back. If you feel like the grind is too much, you could grind just enough for the most expensive item in the game (the `Fairlight Excalibur`), then just save-buy-unlock-load for the rest of the items.
