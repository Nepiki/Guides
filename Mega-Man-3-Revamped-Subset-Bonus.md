<!--StartFragment--><h1>2) Introduction</h1>

A remastered version of Mega Man 3, this game had great potential and this Rom Hack completely fleshes it out (i recommend trying Mega Man 4 Voyage and Rockman 6 Unique Harassment for similar masterpieces that surpass the source material in gigantic measures). 
Massive thanks to wolfman2000 for finding such useful Code Notes for the game.

note: for sake of keeping the Logic simple if you switch to a weapon the achievement will be cancelled regardless of if you pressed the shoot button or not. This applies to all except two* of the doc robot achievements.
