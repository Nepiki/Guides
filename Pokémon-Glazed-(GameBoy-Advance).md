## 2) Introduction

Pokémon Glazed is a [ROM hack](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=292279) created by Lucbui. It is a hack of Pokémon Emerald and features an entirely new region to explore, a return to Johto and also a few islands. The Pokémon all come from generation 1 to 6, and some improvements that have been made in later games are also applied in this hack.

**Do note: The achievement set for this ROM hack is based on the 7b version, and will not work for later versions.**

## 3) Walkthrough

**Step 1: Story Achievements (2 missable)**

What you have to focus on first is just beating the game. Since there are no missable achievements aside from failing to catch the legendary Pokémon, this should pose no trouble and the guide is not mandatory up till that part. Do keep in mind that the missable achievements for miscellaneous Pokémon are the Mudkip at the very start, and the Miltank in Johto.

**Step 2: Legendary Achievements (all missable)**

After the game is beaten completely, you have access to all legendary Pokémon. These make up for most of the achievements, so have fun unlocking them!

**Step 3: Miscellaneous Achievements + clean-up (not missable)**

Miscellaneous achievements that you might have missed during your playthrough. None of these are missable.
