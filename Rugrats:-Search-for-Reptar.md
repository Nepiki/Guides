There are two ways to start the game: the normal [Start Game] way and by entering [Training] then proceeding through the exit.

<details><summary>Spoilers</summary>Spike can be found out in the backyard in Pickle's Home. Various toys and items are scattered about. There are three different items that Spike will retrieve if thrown: the yellow ball, the stick, and the bone.</details>

<details><summary>Spoilers</summary>Mainly annoying due to the finicky nature of how hard the golf ball is actually hit and the fact that you have to replay through the entire course if you have to try again. On occasion it seems a full-powered swing slightly off-centered towards the right will land you a hole-in-one.</details>

![Image](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/136866.png) **[Stranger Danger](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/124410)** _~Defeat Mr. Friend without taking damage._

<details><summary>Spoilers</summary>Honestly this is the most difficult achievement out of the set. Originally I wasn't going to implement it but there is a technique.

The first stage of the fight is easy, just do as the game suggests and knock out the first Mr. Friend with cans lying around (avoid using balls - they bounce back and can damage you).

The second stage throws you against 3 of the freaky clowns. RNG plays a role here as sometimes one of the Mr. Friends is freakishly fast. It's best to just restart the level if you find yourself in this predicament. Now for the fun part. You'll notice they're practically invincible to having stuff tossed at them. The game recommends you kick them but don't do that as sometimes the kick is delayed and they'll get a hit on you. First you'll want to take out one of the Friends with cans. Once the 1st one is down, cans are no longer useful. I found that jumping at them with well-timed jumps will allow you to bowl them over without getting hurt. Take out your 2nd one with this tactic. The last one is trickier. There is a box out in the open near the stairs that you can climb onto. Once you're on top of that box, Mr. Friend can't climb up since you're in the way and he can't hurt you because you're too high. Simply jump down onto his head and he'll get knocked back. Repeat until you explode the last clown to bits.</details>

<details><summary>Spoilers</summary>

**You must start the game via Training (see Training Wheels achievement) and collect the Reptar Bars there in order to complete this achievement**. There are 112 total Reptar Bars that can be collected. (Note: There may be more but thorough searching through game play, videos, walkthroughs, etc. doesn't seem to reveal more than 112.) All Reptar Bars can be found normally within the levels unless otherwise noted. Some levels have missable bars. The locations are as follows:

* Training [m] (6)
